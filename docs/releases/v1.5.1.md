# Release v1.5.1 — Release Management Pack Optimization

Date: 2025-11-25

## Highlights

- Significant token optimization and refactoring of the `bmad-release-management` expansion pack.
- Transitioned from verbose, single-file tasks to concise, executable tasks supported by modular templates and dedicated methodology guides.
- Improved efficiency, readability, and maintainability for AI agents.

## What’s New

- **Optimized Task Files (`tasks/*.md`)**: Rewritten to be lean, high-level checklists focused on execution.
- **New Methodology Guides (`data/*.md`)**: Eight new guides providing detailed, human-readable context for tasks, reducing token load during execution.
- **Modular Release Plan Templates (`templates/*.yaml`)**: Split into focused templates for planning, quality assessment, deployment planning, and retrospectives.
- **New Scope Analysis Checklist**: `checklists/scope-analysis-checklist.md` added to enhance scope definition.
- **Removed Redundant Data Files**: `data/versioning-strategies.md`, `data/changelog-conventions.md`, and `data/deployment-patterns.md` removed; agents now leverage common knowledge.
