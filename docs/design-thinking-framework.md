# The Design Thinking Framework

## 1. Introduction to Design Thinking

Design Thinking is a non-linear, iterative process that teams use to understand users, challenge assumptions, redefine problems, and create innovative solutions to prototype and test. At its core, it is a human-centered approach to innovation that draws from the designer's toolkit to integrate the needs of people, the possibilities of technology, and the requirements for business success.

It is particularly useful for solving problems that are ill-defined or unknown, by re-framing the problem in human-centric ways, creating many ideas in brainstorming sessions, and adopting a hands-on approach in prototyping and testing.

## 2. The Five Phases of Design Thinking

The Design Thinking process is often broken down into five distinct phases. It's important to note that these phases are not always sequential. They can often run in parallel, be repeated, and are not always followed in a specific order.

### Phase 1: Empathize
**Goal:** To gain an empathetic understanding of the problem you are trying to solve.

This phase is about putting aside your own assumptions about the world in order to gain insight into users and their needs. Empathy is crucial to a human-centered design process as it allows designers to understand the user's motivations, experiences, and pain points.

**Common Activities:**
- **User Interviews:** Conducting one-on-one interviews to hear users' stories and perspectives.
- **Observation:** Watching users in their natural environment to understand their behaviors and context.
- **Empathy Maps:** An empathy map is a collaborative tool teams use to gain a deeper insight into their customers. It helps synthesize research and build a shared understanding of the user. It is typically broken down into four quadrants:
    - **Says:** What the user says out loud during an interview or observation.
    - **Thinks:** What the user might be thinking but not saying. What are their motivations, goals, and concerns?
    - **Does:** The actions and behaviors the user takes. What are they physically doing?
    - **Feels:** The user's emotional state during the experience. What excites, worries, or frustrates them?
- **Surveys and Questionnaires:** Gathering quantitative and qualitative data from a large user group.

**Tools and Techniques:**
- **Techniques:** Stakeholder Maps, User Journey Mapping, AEIOU (Activities, Environments, Interactions, Objects, Users) framework.
- **Survey Tools:** Google Forms, SurveyMonkey, Typeform for scalable data collection.
- **Collaboration & Synthesis:** Miro, Mural, or FigJam to create empathy maps, cluster findings, and visualize user data.
- **Interview & Transcription:** Zoom or Google Meet for remote interviews, and Otter.ai for automated transcription.

### Phase 2: Define
**Goal:** To analyze your observations and synthesize them in order to define the core problems that you and your team have identified.

In the Define stage, you put together the information you have created and gathered during the Empathize phase. You will analyze your observations to define the core problems. This phase helps the team to establish features, functions, and any other elements that will allow them to solve the problems.

**Common Activities:**
- **Personas:** Creating fictional characters, which represent the different user types that might use a service or product.
- **Problem Statements (Point of View - POV):** Crafting a clear, actionable problem statement that focuses on a specific user, their need, and the insight you've uncovered. For example: "An adult user with a busy schedule needs a way to quickly prepare healthy meals because they want to maintain a balanced diet without spending too much time cooking."
- **"How Might We" (HMW) Questions:** Framing your problem statements as questions to prepare for the ideation phase (e.g., "How might we help busy adults prepare healthy meals quickly?").

**Tools and Techniques:**
- **Techniques:** Affinity Diagrams (to group insights), Root Cause Analysis (e.g., 5 Whys), and storyboarding the problem.
- **Digital Whiteboards:** Miro, Mural, or FigJam are essential for collaboratively synthesizing research data into personas, POVs, and HMW questions.
- **Documentation Tools:** Confluence, Notion, or Google Docs to formally document the defined problem statement and user personas, creating a source of truth for the team.

### Phase 3: Ideate
**Goal:** To generate a wide range of creative ideas.

With a solid understanding of your users and a clear problem statement, it's time to start generating ideas. The Ideate phase is a "no judgment" zone where the team is encouraged to think outside the box and come up with as many potential solutions as possible. Quantity trumps quality at this stage.

**Common Activities:**
- **Brainstorming:** A group activity where participants share ideas freely.
- **Mind Mapping:** Visually organizing information and ideas around a central concept.
- **SCAMPER:** A technique that uses action verbs (Substitute, Combine, Adapt, Modify, Put to another use, Eliminate, Reverse) to prompt new ideas.
- **Sketching:** Drawing rough ideas to quickly visualize concepts.

**Tools and Techniques:**
- **Techniques:** Reverse Brainstorming (focusing on causing the problem to find solutions), Bodystorming (physically acting out the user experience), and creative constraints.
- **Digital Whiteboards:** Miro, Mural, and FigJam provide infinite canvases for brainstorming, mind mapping, and organizing ideas.
- **Idea Management:** Tools like Stormboard or IdeaBoardz can help structure brainstorming sessions and voting on ideas.

### Phase 4: Prototype
**Goal:** To build inexpensive, scaled-down versions of the product or specific features.

A prototype is an experimental model of an idea that allows you to test it before investing a lot of time and money. Prototypes can range from simple paper mockups to interactive digital simulations. The aim is to create something tangible that users can interact with, providing a way to test and refine the solutions developed in the previous stages.

**Common Activities:**
- **Paper Prototypes:** Creating hand-drawn sketches of user interfaces.
- **Wireframes and Mockups:** Creating low-to-high fidelity digital representations of the product.
- **Role-Playing:** Acting out scenarios to test service-based solutions.
- **Physical Models:** Building simple models using materials like cardboard, clay, or LEGOs.

**Tools and Techniques:**
- **Low-Fidelity Prototyping:**
  - **Tools:** Pen and paper, Balsamiq for creating basic, clickable wireframes.
- **High-Fidelity Prototyping:**
  - **Tools:** Figma, Sketch, and Adobe XD for creating visually detailed and interactive prototypes that closely resemble the final product.
  - **Specialized Tools:** Proto.io or InVision for advanced animations and transitions.
- **Physical Prototyping:** 3D printers, CNC machines, and simple materials like foam and cardboard.

### Phase 5: Test
**Goal:** To gather user feedback on the prototypes and refine the solution.

In the Test phase, you solicit feedback from users on the prototypes you have created. This is another iterative phase where the results are often used to redefine one or more problems and inform the understanding of the users. The feedback helps you to refine the solution and make improvements.

**Common Activities:**
- **Usability Testing:** Observing users as they interact with your prototype.
- **A/B Testing:** Presenting two different versions of a design to users to see which one performs better.
- **Feedback Sessions:** Asking users for their thoughts and opinions on the prototype.

**Tools and Techniques:**
- **Techniques:** Moderated and unmoderated usability testing, session recordings, heatmaps, and analytics review.
- **Remote Testing Platforms:** Maze and UserTesting.com to get feedback on prototypes from a wide range of users.
- **Behavioral Analytics:** Hotjar (for heatmaps and session recordings) or Google Analytics to understand how users are interacting with a live product or high-fidelity prototype.
- **A/B Testing Tools:** Optimizely or VWO (Visual Website Optimizer) to test different versions of a design and measure performance.

## 3. Key Principles and Mindsets

- **Human-Centered:** The process starts with empathy and a deep focus on the people you are designing for.
- **Collaborative:** Design Thinking encourages collaboration between multi-disciplinary teams to bring different perspectives to the table.
- **Iterative:** It is a cyclical process of prototyping, testing, and refining ideas. Failure is seen as a learning opportunity.
- **Show, Don't Tell:** Creating tangible prototypes to communicate ideas is more effective than just talking about them.
- **Bias Toward Action:** Design Thinking is a hands-on approach. Instead of endless discussion, the focus is on doing.

## 4. Benefits of Design Thinking

- **Reduces Risk:** By testing ideas early and inexpensively, it reduces the risk of launching a product that nobody wants.
- **Fosters Innovation:** It encourages a culture of creativity and experimentation, leading to breakthrough solutions.
- **Improves User Engagement:** Products and services designed with empathy are more likely to resonate with users.
- **Faster Time-to-Market:** The iterative nature of the process allows for quicker learning cycles and faster development.
