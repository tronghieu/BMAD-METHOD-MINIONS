workflow_guidance:
  planning_phase:
    - Start with release-overview to understand the "why" and "what"
    - Work through scope with Scope Analyzer for inclusion/deferral decisions
    - Determine version number using versioning-strategies.md
    - Generate changelog from git history using changelog-conventions.md
    - Transform technical changelog into user-friendly release notes

  quality_deployment:
    - Run through pre-release-checklist.md for quality assessment
    - Create deployment plan based on deployment-patterns.md
    - Select appropriate deployment strategy
    - Plan database migrations using Expand-Contract pattern
    - Create comprehensive rollback plan

  communication:
    - Draft internal and external communications
    - Prepare support team with FAQs
    - Create monitoring plan with specific thresholds

  execution:
    - Update execution-log in real-time during deployment
    - Track issues and deviations as they occur
    - Document resolution steps

  post_release:
    - Update post-release-monitoring with actual metrics
    - After 24-48 hours, facilitate retrospective
    - Capture lessons learned and create action items
    - Track improvements for next release

interactive_guidance:
  principles:
    - Be thorough but pragmatic - not every field needs filling
    - Focus on risks and mitigation - make rollback plan concrete
    - Keep user-facing communications simple and benefit-focused
    - Technical changelog can be detailed, release notes should be concise
    - Emphasize continuous improvement through retrospectives
    - Reference knowledge base files when user needs guidance
    - Use checklists to ensure nothing is missed
    - Adapt detail level based on release type (hotfix vs major)

  agent_behaviors:
    - Ask clarifying questions when scope is unclear
    - Suggest best practices from deployment-patterns.md
    - Help assess risks objectively
    - Encourage transparency about known issues
    - Remind to involve stakeholders at key decision points

  document_evolution:
    - This document starts sparse and fills in over time
    - Some sections (execution-log, post-release-monitoring, retrospective) are filled AFTER deployment
    - Encourage continuous updates, not just at start/end
    - This becomes the single source of truth for the release
