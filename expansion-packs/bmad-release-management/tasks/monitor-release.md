**Release Management Phase**: Post-Deployment Monitoring
**Duration**: 24-48 hours (with check-ins)
**Agent**: Release Manager
**Difficulty**: Medium

## Purpose

Continuously monitor the release after deployment to ensure it remains stable and healthy. This task catches issues early and provides data for retrospective analysis.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this task, ensure you have:

- [ ] **Deployment completed successfully**: Release is live in production
- [ ] **Monitoring dashboards accessible**: All metrics visible
- [ ] **Baseline metrics documented**: Pre-release performance data
- [ ] **Alert thresholds configured**: Notifications set up
- [ ] **On-call team available**: Engineers ready to respond
- [ ] **Post-deployment checklist**: `checklists/post-deployment-checklist.md`

## Step-by-Step Process

### Phase 1: Intensive Monitoring (First 4 Hours)

#### 1.1 Hour 1: Critical Observation Period

**Every 15 minutes, check**:

**Error Rates**:
```
Time        5xx Errors   4xx Errors   Exceptions
15:15       0.08%        2.1%         3/min     ‚úÖ
15:30       0.12%        2.3%         5/min     ‚úÖ
15:45       0.09%        2.0%         4/min     ‚úÖ
16:00       0.11%        2.2%         4/min     ‚úÖ
```

**Performance Metrics**:
```
Time        p50     p95     p99     Throughput
15:15       120ms   420ms   890ms   125 req/s  ‚úÖ
15:30       118ms   425ms   895ms   128 req/s  ‚úÖ
15:45       122ms   430ms   900ms   124 req/s  ‚úÖ
16:00       119ms   422ms   885ms   127 req/s  ‚úÖ
```

**Red Flags** (immediate attention):
- Error rate >2% sustained
- Response time >2x baseline
- Throughput dropped >30%
- Memory continuously climbing
- New error types appearing

**Yellow Flags** (watch closely):
- Error rate 1-2%
- Response time 1.5x baseline
- Throughput down 15-30%
- Gradual memory increase

#### 1.2 Review Error Logs

Check for new error patterns:

```bash
# View recent errors
kubectl logs -l app=myapp --since=1h | grep ERROR

# Count error types
kubectl logs -l app=myapp --since=1h | grep ERROR | sort | uniq -c

# Look for stack traces
kubectl logs -l app=myapp --since=1h | grep -A 10 "Exception"
```

**Look for**:
- Errors that didn't exist before deployment
- High frequency errors (>10/min)
- Database connection errors
- External API timeouts
- Authentication/authorization failures

#### 1.3 Check Business Metrics

Verify business operations normal:

```
Metric                  Baseline    Current    Status
User sign-ups/hour      50          48         ‚úÖ (-4%)
Conversion rate         3.2%        3.3%       ‚úÖ (+3%)
Transaction success     99.5%       99.4%      ‚úÖ (-0.1%)
API calls/minute        850         880        ‚úÖ (+4%)
```

**Red Flags**:
- Conversion rate drops >20%
- Transaction success <95%
- Sign-ups dropped significantly

#### 1.4 Monitor Infrastructure

Check system health:

```
Resource          Baseline    Current    Status
CPU usage         45%         48%        ‚úÖ
Memory usage      60%         65%        ‚úÖ
Disk I/O          20MB/s      22MB/s     ‚úÖ
Network traffic   15MB/s      16MB/s     ‚úÖ
```

**Red Flags**:
- CPU >80% sustained
- Memory >85% or continuously climbing
- Disk I/O maxed out
- Network saturation

#### 1.5 Post Hour 1 Update

Send status update to team:

```
‚úÖ v2.1.0 - Hour 1 Status

Error Rate: 0.10% (baseline: 0.08%) ‚úÖ
Response Time p95: 425ms (baseline: 450ms) ‚úÖ

NullPointerException    92       18%          Low
DatabaseException       43       8%           Medium

Total: 520 errors (baseline: 480)
```

For each error type:
- Is it new or pre-existing?
- Is frequency acceptable?
- Needs immediate fix or can wait?

#### 3.3 User Feedback Summary

Compile user reports:

**Support Tickets (24 hours)**:
```
Total: 48 tickets (baseline: 50)
New issues: 3
Known issues: 45

New Issue Summary:
