**Activities**:
- Brainstormed expansion pack concept
- Simplified from 10 agents to 5 agents
- Consolidated templates into single release-plan.md
- Created building-plan.md document
- **COMPLETED Phase 1**: Created folder structure and all 4 knowledge base files

  - deployment-checklist.md (step-by-step deployment execution with multiple deployment patterns)
  - post-deployment-checklist.md (24-48 hour verification with metrics tracking)
  - rollback-checklist.md (emergency rollback procedures with decision tree)
- **COMPLETED Phase 3**: Created unified release-plan template
  - templates/release-plan.md (11 major sections, comprehensive with LLM guidance)
  - Includes: Overview, Scope, Changelog, Release Notes, Quality Assessment, Deployment Plan, Communications, Monitoring, Execution Log, Post-Release Monitoring, Retrospective
  - Built with template variables ({{placeholders}}) and [[LLM: instructions]] for agent guidance
  - NOTE: Later refactored to YAML format in Session 3
- **COMPLETED Phase 4**: Created all 8 tasks
  - tasks/create-release-plan.md (comprehensive 9-phase planning process with Release Manager)

- Consider additional features (CI/CD integrations, monitoring tool integrations)

---

### Session 3 - 2025-10-28 (Refactoring)
**Activities**:
- Refactored all 5 agents to match official BMAD pattern
- Removed extensive markdown documentation after YAML blocks
- Reduced agent files from ~400 lines to ~95-105 lines each
- Kept concise YAML blocks with all essential information
- Added brief "Startup Context" sections (10-20 lines) following character-psychologist pattern
- All agents now follow consistent structure:
  - BMAD Core header
  - ACTIVATION-NOTICE
  - YAML block (~80 lines)
  - Optional Startup Context (~15 lines)

**Changes Made - Agents**:
- release-manager.md: 411 lines ‚Üí 99 lines (76% reduction)
- scope-analyzer.md: 392 lines ‚Üí 86 lines (78% reduction)
- quality-gatekeeper.md: ~450 lines ‚Üí 89 lines (80% reduction)
- deployment-coordinator.md: ~450 lines ‚Üí 97 lines (78% reduction)
- communication-specialist.md: ~450 lines ‚Üí 95 lines (79% reduction)

**Changes Made - Templates**:
- Rebuilt release-plan.md ‚Üí release-plan.yaml to match BMAD template pattern
- Converted from markdown with {{placeholders}} and [[LLM: instructions]]
- Now uses YAML structure like story-tmpl.yaml with:
  - Template metadata (id, version, output format)
  - Workflow configuration (mode: interactive, elicitation)
  - Structured sections with id, title, type, instruction
  - Owner and editors defined per section
  - Elicit flags for interactive sections
  - Subsections for hierarchical organization
  - References to knowledge base files and checklists
  - Workflow guidance and interactive principles

**Rationale**:
Comparison with official BMAD showed:
1. Agents were too verbose - official keeps everything in YAML + minimal context
2. Templates should be YAML, not markdown - enables machine-readable structure and clear interactive flow

This refactoring makes the pack fully consistent with BMAD standards.

**Word Count After Refactoring**: ~93,000 words (down from ~100,000+)
- Agent files now contribute ~2,000 words instead of ~25,000 words
- Template converted to structured YAML (~500 lines) from markdown (~968 lines)

### Session 4 - 2025-10-28 (Dual-Approach Enhancement)
**Activities**:
- Enhanced Release Manager agent to support both manual and template-driven workflows
- Investigated BMAD template usage patterns by examining:
  - `.bmad-core/agents/analyst.md` (command patterns)
  - `.bmad-core/tasks/create-next-story.md` (task workflows)
  - `common/tasks/create-doc.md` (universal template processor)
- Added dual command support to release-manager.md

**Changes Made**:
- **release-manager.md**:
  - Added command: `create-plan: use task create-doc with release-plan.yaml` (template-driven)
  - Kept existing: `plan: Start manual release planning process` (guided workflow)
  - Added `create-doc.md` to task dependencies
  - Updated REQUEST-RESOLUTION with examples for both commands
  - Enhanced Startup Context to explain both approaches

**How Templates Work in BMAD**:
```
User Command ‚Üí Agent ‚Üí Task ‚Üí Template ‚Üí Output File

Example Flow:
User: *create-plan
  ‚Üì
Release Manager (agent)
  ‚Üì
common/tasks/create-doc.md (universal template processor)
  ‚Üì
templates/release-plan.yaml (YAML template definition)
  ‚Üì
docs/release/v2.1.0-release-plan.md (generated output)
```

**Two Approaches Now Available**:
1. **Manual Workflow** (`*plan`)
   - Uses `tasks/create-release-plan.md` (590 lines of step-by-step guidance)
   - Custom logic for git analysis, scope analysis, versioning decisions
   - 9-phase guided process with agent-driven interactions
   - More control and flexibility

2. **Template-Driven** (`*create-plan`)
   - Uses `common/tasks/create-doc.md` + `templates/release-plan.yaml`
   - Follows BMAD universal pattern with structured elicitation
   - Interactive section-by-section creation with 1-9 options menu
   - Consistent with other BMAD document creation workflows
   - Sections with `elicit: true` trigger mandatory user interaction

**Rationale**:
- **Manual approach**: Best for teams that need custom logic, git history analysis, and step-by-step guidance
- **Template-driven approach**: Best for teams that want consistent BMAD elicitation patterns and structured document creation
- Both approaches generate the same final document structure
- User can choose based on preference and workflow style

**Pack Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETE with dual-approach support

- Example Pack: `/expansion-packs/bmad-design-thinking-facilitator/`
- Example Pack: `/expansion-packs/bmad-autonomous-teams-mission-orchestra/`

---

## Open Questions / Decisions Needed

1. Should we support multiple versioning strategies (SemVer vs CalVer) or pick one?
   - **Decision**: Support both, let teams choose in pack configuration

2. How detailed should deployment steps be in the template?
   - **Decision**: TBD

3. Should we integrate with specific CI/CD tools (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI)?
   - **Decision**: Tool-agnostic, provide patterns teams can adapt

4. Should monitoring use specific tools (Datadog, New Relic)?
   - **Decision**: TBD

---

## Notes

- Keep it simple - real teams need practical, not perfect
- Focus on the 80% use case first (standard releases)
- Make it easy to customize for different team sizes and processes
- Document everything so users can adapt to their context
