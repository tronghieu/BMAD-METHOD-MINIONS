#### Opening (5 minutes)

**Facilitator Script:**
```
"Welcome everyone. Today we're aligning on the [Mission Name] mission.

Ground Rules:
1. We're here to achieve shared understanding and voluntary commitment
2. Speak up about concerns - now is the time
3. 'No' is an acceptable answer if explained
4. We'll document all decisions and commitments
5. Parking lot for items needing separate discussion

Our outcome: Clear commitments from each team or a path to get there."
```

**Quick Check-in:**

- Document fallback plans for critical items

#### Commitment Ceremony (20 minutes)

**Structured Commitment Process:**

1. **Set Context** (2 minutes)
   ```
   "We're now going to get formal commitments. Remember:
   - Commitment means your team will deliver as specified
   - Conditional commitment must state clear conditions
   - No commitment is better than false commitment
   - We'll document everything formally"
   ```

2. **Team-by-Team Commitment** (15 minutes)

   For each team, capture:

   **Team Lead Statement Format:**
   ```

   - With these conditions: [if applicable]
   - These risks exist: [if applicable]"
   ```

   **Commitment Levels:**
   - ‚úÖ **Full Commit**: "We will deliver X by Y"
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è **Conditional**: "We can deliver X by Y if Z happens"
   - ‚ùå **Cannot Commit**: "We cannot deliver because..."
   - üî¨ **Needs Investigation**: "We need to research before committing"

3. **Address Non-Commitments** (3 minutes)
   - What would enable commitment?
   - Can scope be adjusted?
   - Can timeline be shifted?
   - Can resources be added?

**Documentation in Real-Time:**
```markdown

| AI | ML Model | ‚úÖ Full | None | Sprint 4 | |
```

### 4. Facilitation Techniques

#### Managing Dynamics

**The Dominator:**
- Use explicit turn-taking
- "Let's hear from teams we haven't heard from"
- Private message: "Great points - let's get others' input"

**The Silent Team:**
- Direct questions: "[Name], what's your team's view?"
- Break into smaller groups
- Follow up 1:1 after meeting

**The Pessimist:**
- Acknowledge concerns: "Valid point, let's document that risk"
- Focus on solutions: "What would address that concern?"
- Time-box negativity

**The Over-Committer:**
- Reality check: "Let's verify capacity"
- "What would you de-prioritize for this?"
- Document assumptions explicitly

#### Keeping Energy Up

- Take a 5-minute break at 45 minutes
- Stand up for dependency mapping
- Use humor appropriately
- Celebrate agreements vocally
- Keep visible progress tracker

#### Managing Conflict

**When Teams Disagree:**
1. Clarify the disagreement precisely
2. Find common ground first
3. Explore win-win options
4. Escalate if needed (but rarely)
5. Document disagreement and path forward

**When Resources Are Contested:**
1. Return to mission priorities
2. Look for creative solutions
3. Consider phasing or alternating
4. Escalate to leadership if critical

### 6. Common Pitfalls

**Avoid These Mistakes:**

‚ùå **Forcing Commitment**
- Pressuring teams to commit when not ready
- Better to identify issues now than fail later

‚ùå **Solving Everything**
- Trying to resolve all issues in meeting
- Focus on alignment, solve details later

‚ùå **Poor Time Management**
- Letting one topic dominate
- Stick to agenda, use parking lot

‚ùå **Vague Commitments**
- "We'll do our best"
- Get specific deliverables and dates

‚ùå **Missing Documentation**
- Relying on memory
- Document everything in real-time

‚ùå **Skipping Follow-Up**
- Assuming everyone's aligned
- Always get written confirmation

### 7. Contingency Planning

**If Key People Missing:**
- Reschedule if critical mass not present
- Or focus on what you can align on
- Schedule follow-up for missing pieces

**If Major Blocking Issue Surfaces:**
- Document the blocker clearly
- Assign owner to resolve
- Schedule follow-up alignment
- Proceed with what you can

**If Meeting Runs Over:**
- Ask for 15 more minutes consent
- Or schedule immediate follow-up
- Prioritize commitments if time limited

**If No Consensus Reached:**
- Document different positions
- Escalate to executive sponsor
- Schedule decision meeting
- Pause mission if necessary
