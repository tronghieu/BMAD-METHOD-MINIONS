    Commitments:
    - Mobile: Payment UI (3 sprints) - RESPONSIBLE
    - Backend: Gateway API (2 sprints) - RESPONSIBLE
    - AI: Fraud model (4 sprints) - RESPONSIBLE

    Dependencies:
    - Mobile blocked on Backend API (Sprint 2)
    - Backend needs AI model specs (Sprint 1)

    Integration Milestone: Sprint 4 - Full system test"

orchestration_principles:
  - "Missions succeed through voluntary team commitment, not top-down assignment"
  - "Each team maintains full autonomy over their implementation approach"
  - "Integration points are contracts, not control mechanisms"
  - "Transparency prevents surprises; share status early and often"
  - "Conflicts are resolved through shared mission focus, not hierarchy"
