# Task: Facilitate Idea Building

**Design Thinking Phase**: Ideate
**Duration**: 20-30 minutes
**Agent**: Ideation Coach
**Difficulty**: Low-Medium

## Purpose

Transform initial ideas into more developed concepts through collaborative building, combining, and enhancement using "Yes, and..." thinking.

## Prerequisites

- [ ] Initial brainstorming completed (30+ ideas generated)
- [ ] All ideas visible on wall or board
- [ ] Team available for building session
- [ ] Materials ready for additions

## "Yes, And..." Mindset

**Core Principle**: Accept and build on ideas rather than reject

**Instead of**:
- ❌ "No, that won't work because..."
- ❌ "But have you considered..."
- ❌ "That's not realistic..."

**Say**:
- ✅ "Yes, and we could also..."
- ✅ "Yes, and to make it even better..."
- ✅ "Yes, and what if we combined it with..."

## Step-by-Step Process

### Phase 1: Idea Review (5 minutes)

**Silent Gallery Walk**:
- Review all generated ideas
- Note favorites or interesting ones
- Look for combination opportunities
- Don't discuss yet

### Phase 2: Build on Ideas (10-15 minutes)

#### Method 1: Popcorn Building

**Process**:
1. Person A reads an idea aloud
2. Person B: "Yes, and [addition]..."
3. Person C: "Yes, and [further addition]..."
4. Continue for 2-3 minutes per idea
5. Capture enhanced version

**Example**:
- Original: "Mobile app for meal planning"
- Person B: "Yes, and it learns your preferences"
- Person C: "Yes, and it orders ingredients automatically"
- Person D: "Yes, and it connects with your calendar"
- Person E: "Yes, and it suggests meals based on time available"

#### Method 2: Pair Building

**Process**:
1. Break into pairs
2. Each pair selects 3-5 ideas
3. Spend 2 minutes per idea building it out
4. Add features, benefits, scenarios
5. Share enhanced concepts

#### Method 3: Mashup Ideas

**Combine two unrelated ideas**:
- Pick idea A and idea B at random
- "How might we combine these?"
- Create hybrid concept
- Name the mashup

**Example Mashup**:
- Idea A: "Gamification of learning"
- Idea B: "Peer mentorship platform"
- Mashup: "Learn-by-teaching game where students earn points by helping others"

### Phase 3: Enhance with Details (5-10 minutes)

**For Promising Ideas, Add**:

**User Benefit**: How does this help the user?
**Key Feature**: What makes this special?
**Use Scenario**: When/where would they use it?
**Differentiation**: Why is this better than alternatives?

**Template**:
```
IDEA: [Name]
Description: [One sentence]
Benefits: [2-3 key benefits]
Special Feature: [What makes it unique]
Scenario: [Example of use]
```

## Building Techniques

### Technique 1: Feature Addition

**Add capabilities to make idea stronger**:
- What features would enhance this?
- What could make it more powerful?
- What's missing?

### Technique 2: Context Expansion

**Apply to different contexts**:
- What if this was for [different user]?
- What if this was in [different location]?
- What if this was at [different time]?

### Technique 3: Constraint Removal

**"What if we had unlimited..."**:
- ...budget?
- ...technology?
- ...time?
- ...resources?

(Then work backwards to realistic version)

### Technique 4: Extreme Scaling

**Make it much bigger or smaller**:
- 10x bigger: Enterprise-wide solution
- 10x smaller: Single-feature micro-tool
- See what insights emerge

## Expected Outputs

1. **Enhanced Ideas**: Original ideas with added details
2. **Hybrid Concepts**: Combined/mashed ideas
3. **Developed Concepts**: 5-10 ideas with fuller descriptions
4. **Building Notes**: Additions and enhancements captured

## Common Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge: "People reverting to criticism"

**Solutions**:
- Enforce "Yes, and..." language
- Pause and remind of building mindset
- Model positive building yourself
- Make it playful/gamelike

### Challenge: "Ideas becoming too complex"

**Solutions**:
- Focus on one enhancement at a time
- Keep core concept clear
- Note complexity for later evaluation
- Remember: building ≠ final design

### Challenge: "Can't combine unrelated ideas"

**Solutions**:
- Find shared underlying need
- Look for complementary aspects
- Create "inspired by" rather than direct mashup
- It's okay if some don't combine - move on

## Success Indicators

✅ **Ideas evolved**: Concepts more developed than initial
✅ **Combinations created**: Hybrid ideas emerged
✅ **Team engaged**: Energy and building on each other
✅ **Details added**: Ideas have more specificity
✅ **Variety maintained**: Still have diverse approaches

## Quick Building Exercises

### Exercise 1: Yes, And Circle (5 min)
- Stand in circle
- Person 1: Shares idea
- Each person adds "Yes, and..."
- Go around circle 2-3 times

### Exercise 2: Rapid Remix (5 min)
- Draw 2 random ideas from hat
- 2 minutes to combine them
- Share mashup concepts

### Exercise 3: Feature Sprint (5 min)
- Select one idea
- Each person adds one feature
- Build feature list to 20+ items
- No judgment, just add

## Tips

**Encourage**:
- Wild additions
- Unexpected combinations
- Building on the crazy ideas
- Laughter and playfulness

**Discourage**:
- Feasibility discussions
- "Reality checks"
- Critique or evaluation
- Shutting down ideas

**Remember**: Still in divergent mode - save evaluation for next phase!
