# Task: Cluster and Theme Ideas

**Design Thinking Phase**: Ideate
**Duration**: 20-30 minutes
**Agent**: Ideation Coach
**Difficulty**: Medium

## Purpose

Organize generated ideas into meaningful clusters and identify thematic patterns to make sense of large idea volumes and prepare for evaluation.

## Prerequisites

- [ ] Brainstorming completed (50+ ideas)
- [ ] All ideas visible on wall/board
- [ ] Team assembled
- [ ] Additional sticky notes/markers available

## Step-by-Step Process

### Phase 1: Prepare Ideas (5 minutes)

#### Initial Filtering

**Quick cleanup**:
- Remove exact duplicates
- Combine very similar ideas (keep both if meaningfully different)
- Number all ideas for reference (#1, #2, etc.)
- Ensure all are legible

**Don't remove yet**:
- Wild ideas
- Seemingly unrelated ideas
- Ideas that seem "bad"

### Phase 2: Silent Clustering (10 minutes)

#### Affinity Mapping Process

**Individual Clustering (5 min)**:
- Each person silently moves ideas into groups
- Group similar concepts together
- Move ideas others have grouped
- Okay to create new groups
- No talking yet

**Collaborative Refinement (5 min)**:
- Now discuss placements
- "I grouped these because..."
- Debate where ideas belong
- Some ideas may belong in multiple clusters
- Move ideas as needed

#### Clustering Criteria

**Group by**:
- **Similar approach**: "All use AI/automation"
- **Similar user need**: "All address onboarding"
- **Similar implementation**: "All are mobile-first"
- **Similar scope**: "All are quick wins"

**Typical cluster sizes**: 3-8 ideas per cluster

### Phase 3: Name Themes (10-15 minutes)

#### Create Theme Labels

**For each cluster, identify**:

**Theme Name**: What connects these ideas?
**Description**: What's the common thread?
**Example Ideas**: Which ideas represent this theme?

**Good Theme Names Are**:
- Descriptive (clear what they mean)
- Concise (2-5 words)
- Specific enough to be meaningful

**Examples**:
```
THEME: AI-Powered Personalization
Description: Solutions that use machine learning to adapt to individual users
Ideas: #12, #17, #23, #34, #45

THEME: Simplified Onboarding
Description: Ways to reduce friction in first-time user experience
Ideas: #5, #8, #19, #27, #31, #40

THEME: Social Proof & Trust
Description: Building credibility through community and transparency
Ideas: #3, #14, #22, #29, #38
```

#### Visual Organization

**Create hierarchy**:
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│    MEGA-THEME: Speed & Efficiency   │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Sub-theme: Automation              │
│   • #12: Auto-fill forms            │
│   • #18: Smart defaults             │
│   • #24: Predictive suggestions     │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Sub-theme: Shortcuts               │
│   • #7: Keyboard commands           │
│   • #15: Quick actions menu         │
│   • #31: Voice controls             │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Phase 4: Identify Patterns (5 minutes)

#### Pattern Recognition

**Look across clusters**:

**Frequency Patterns**:
- Which themes have most ideas?
- Where is team's energy focused?

**Diversity Patterns**:
- Wide variety or narrow focus?
- Any gaps in coverage?

**Approach Patterns**:
- Technology-focused vs. process-focused?
- Quick fixes vs. systemic solutions?
- User-facing vs. backend improvements?

**Unexpected Patterns**:
- Surprising combinations?
- Contradictory approaches?
- Novel connections?

#### Document Patterns

```
OBSERVATIONS:

Dominant Themes:
- 40% of ideas focus on simplification
- 25% involve automation/AI
- 20% are social/community features

Gaps:
- Few ideas address [specific area]
- Limited mobile-specific solutions

Surprises:
- Strong interest in gamification
- Multiple ideas about offline functionality
```

## Clustering Variations

### Method 1: Pre-Defined Categories

**Set categories first**, then sort ideas:
- Quick Wins vs. Long-term Projects
- Low-cost vs. High-cost
- User-facing vs. Internal improvements
- Platform-specific (Web, Mobile, etc.)

### Method 2: Emergent Clustering

**Let themes emerge** from grouping (used above)

### Method 3: Multi-Dimensional Clustering

**Cluster on different axes**:
- First pass: By approach
- Second pass: By user segment
- Third pass: By journey stage

### Method 4: Spectrum Clustering

**Arrange on continuums**:
```
Simple ←──────────────→ Complex
Quick ←──────────────→ Long-term
Incremental ←─────────→ Radical
```

## Expected Outputs

1. **Clustered Ideas**: Ideas organized into 5-10 theme groups
2. **Theme Labels**: Named and described clusters
3. **Pattern Summary**: Observed themes and gaps
4. **Cluster Map**: Visual organization (photo)
5. **Unclustered Ideas**: "Parking lot" ideas that don't fit

## Common Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge: "Ideas fit multiple clusters"

**Solutions**:
- Duplicate the idea (place in both)
- Choose primary cluster, note secondary
- Create new connecting theme
- Okay to have overlap

### Challenge: "Too many small clusters"

**Solutions**:
- Combine related clusters into larger themes
- Create sub-themes within main themes
- Aim for 5-10 main clusters (not 20+)
- Some ideas can stand alone (parking lot)

### Challenge: "One huge cluster, rest tiny"

**Solutions**:
- Break large cluster into sub-themes
- Check if clustering criteria is too broad
- Look for distinctions within large group
- May indicate clear focus area

### Challenge: "Can't name the theme"

**Solutions**:
- Describe what connects them
- Use example: "Ideas like #12"
- Ask "What problem do these solve?"
- Temporary label is fine ("Group A")

## Success Indicators

✅ **Organized**: Ideas grouped meaningfully
✅ **Themed**: 5-10 clear themes identified
✅ **Labeled**: Each theme has descriptive name
✅ **Patterns visible**: Can see trends and gaps
✅ **Team aligned**: Shared understanding of themes
✅ **Ready for evaluation**: Clear paths forward

## Clustering Tips

**Do**:
- ✅ Use physical/digital sticky notes (easy to move)
- ✅ Allow themes to emerge naturally
- ✅ Create "parking lot" for unclustered ideas
- ✅ Take photos of each stage
- ✅ Involve full team in theming

**Don't**:
- ❌ Force ideas into clusters where they don't fit
- ❌ Create too many tiny clusters (combine!)
- ❌ Discard ideas during clustering (save for later)
- ❌ Spend too long perfecting (good enough to move forward)

## Visual Clustering Techniques

### Color Coding
- Assign colors to themes
- Mark ideas with colored dots
- Easy to see distribution

### Spatial Arrangement
- Related themes near each other
- Outliers to the side
- Create visual map

### Tagging
- Multi-tag ideas
- #mobile #automation #quick-win
- Digital tools make this easy
