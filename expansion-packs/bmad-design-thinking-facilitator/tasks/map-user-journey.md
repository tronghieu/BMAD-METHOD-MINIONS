- [ ] Sticky notes and markers ready

## Journey Map Structure

```
STAGES:     [Stage 1] ‚Üí [Stage 2] ‚Üí [Stage 3] ‚Üí [Stage 4] ‚Üí [Stage 5]

ACTIONS:    [What user does at each stage]

THOUGHTS:   [What user thinks/wonders]

EMOTIONS:   [Emotional curve - highs and lows plotted]
   ‚Üë High
   |
   ‚Üì Low

TOUCHPOINTS: [Points of interaction with product/service]

PAIN POINTS: [Frustrations and obstacles]

OPPORTUNITIES: [Where we can improve]
```

## Step-by-Step Process

### Phase 1: Define Scope (10-15 minutes)

#### Choose Journey Type

**End-to-End Journey**:
- Complete lifecycle experience
- Example: Awareness ‚Üí Purchase ‚Üí Use ‚Üí Renewal

**Focused Journey**:
- Specific process or task
- Example: First-time onboarding
- Example: Making a purchase

#### Select Persona

Choose which user persona to map:
- Start with primary persona
- Create separate maps for different personas
- Note: Different users = different journeys

#### Set Boundaries

Define:
- **Start point**: Where does journey begin?
- **End point**: Where does it conclude?
- **Scope**: What's included/excluded?

### Phase 2: Identify Journey Stages (15-20 minutes)

#### Common Stage Frameworks

**Awareness ‚Üí Consideration ‚Üí Purchase Model**:
1. Awareness (discovering the need/solution)
2. Consideration (evaluating options)
3. Purchase/Signup (deciding and acquiring)
4. Onboarding (getting started)
5. Regular Use (ongoing experience)
6. Problem-Solving (when issues arise)
7. Renewal/Advocacy (retention or churn)

**Service Design Stages**:
1. Pre-Service (before engagement)
2. Service Initiation (first contact)
3. Service Delivery (core experience)
4. Service Completion (wrapping up)
5. Post-Service (after experience)

**Task-Specific Stages**:
Break down specific task into sequential steps
- Example for "Book Flight":
  - Search for flights
  - Compare options
  - Select flight
  - Enter details
  - Payment
  - Confirmation

### Phase 3: Map User Actions (20-25 minutes)

For each stage, document:

**What the user does**:
- Specific actions taken
- Steps in the process
- Tools/channels used

**Example - Onboarding Stage**:
- Downloads app
- Creates account
- Enters personal information
- Completes tutorial
- Attempts first task

**Evidence-Based**:
- Use actual research data
- Include direct observations
- Note workarounds

### Phase 4: Capture Thoughts & Motivations (15-20 minutes)

For each stage, document:

**What the user thinks**:
- Questions they have
- Decisions they're making
- Information they seek
- Concerns or doubts

**Example - Onboarding Stage**:
- "Will this work for my needs?"
- "How long will this take?"
- "Is my data secure?"
- "What if I make a mistake?"

**Use Research Evidence**:
- Interview quotes
- Think-aloud observations
- Survey responses

### Phase 5: Plot Emotional Curve (15-20 minutes)

#### Create Emotion Graph

Draw emotional axis:
```
   ‚Üë Delighted
   | Satisfied
   | Neutral
   | Frustrated
   ‚Üì Angry
```

For each stage:
1. **Assess emotional state** (based on research)
2. **Plot point** on emotion axis
3. **Connect points** to show journey
4. **Mark peaks and valleys**

**Emotional Indicators**:
- üòä Delight: "This is great!"
- üôÇ Satisfaction: "That worked"
- üòê Neutral: No strong reaction
- üòü Frustration: "Why isn't this working?"
- üò† Anger: "This is terrible!"

### Phase 6: Identify Touchpoints (10 minutes)

Mark all interaction points:

**Digital Touchpoints**:
- Website
- Mobile app
- Email
- Chat/support
- Social media
- Ads/notifications

**Physical Touchpoints**:
- Store/location
- Product packaging
- Printed materials
- Customer service (phone)

**Human Touchpoints**:
- Sales interactions
- Support calls
- In-person service

### Phase 7: Highlight Pain Points (15 minutes)

**Identify Where Users Struggle**:
- Confusion moments
- Error states
- Delays/waiting
- Friction points
- Abandonment risks

**Prioritize by**:
- Frequency (how often occurs)
- Severity (how painful)
- Impact (effect on outcome)

**Mark on Map**:
- Use ‚ö†Ô∏è or red flags
- Note specific issues
- Include evidence/quotes

**Example Pain Points**:
- "Can't find password reset" (Stage 1)
- "Unclear shipping costs" (Stage 3)
- "Tutorial too long" (Stage 4)
- "No progress indicator" (Stage 5)

### Phase 8: Spot Opportunities (15 minutes)

**Transformation Questions**:
- How might we eliminate this pain point?
- How might we amplify this positive moment?
- How might we smooth this transition?
- Where could we add value?

**Opportunity Types**:
- **Quick wins**: Easy improvements, high impact
- **Major innovations**: Transformative changes
- **Service gaps**: Unmet needs
- **Delight opportunities**: Exceed expectations

**Mark on Map**:
- Use üí° or green markers
- Link to specific pain points
- Note potential solutions

## Journey Map Variations

### Current-State vs. Future-State

**Current-State Map**:
- Document existing experience
- Based on research evidence
- Shows pain points

**Future-State Map**:
- Envision improved experience
- After implementing solutions
- Shows opportunities realized

### Multi-Lane Journey Map

Add additional swim lanes:
- **Frontend**: User-facing experience
- **Backend**: Behind-the-scenes processes
- **Support Systems**: Enabling infrastructure
- **Business Metrics**: KPIs at each stage

### Comparative Journey Maps

Show different paths:
- Successful vs. Abandoned journey
- Novice vs. Expert user
- Different personas side-by-side

## Expected Outputs

1. **Visual Journey Map**: Complete journey visualization
2. **Emotional Curve**: Plotted emotional experience
3. **Pain Points List**: Prioritized frustrations (5-15 items)
4. **Opportunities List**: Improvement areas (5-10 items)
5. **Journey Insights**: Key patterns (3-7 insights)
6. **Documentation**: Photos of completed map

- Create high-level overview first
- Detail critical stages only
- Break into multiple maps

### Challenge: "Limited research data for some stages"

**Solutions**:
- Mark as assumptions (validate later)
