## Overview
Guide a team through a comprehensive empathy-building session to deeply understand users and their needs.

## Duration
2-4 hours (adjustable based on scope)

## Prerequisites
- Research objectives defined
- Target users identified
- Team assembled (3-8 people)
- Materials prepared

## Materials Needed
- Sticky notes (multiple colors)
- Markers/pens
- Large wall or whiteboard space
- Empathy map templates
- Journey map template
- Recording device (optional)
- Timer

## Session Structure

### 1. Opening & Context Setting (15 min)

#### Facilitator Script
"Welcome everyone! Today we're going to step into our users' shoes to truly understand their experiences, needs, and challenges. Remember, we're not here to validate our assumptions - we're here to discover what we don't know."

#### Activities
1. **Set Ground Rules:**
   - No judgment on user behaviors
   - Observe don't interpret
   - Capture everything
   - Stay curious

2. **Share Research Context:**
   - Who are we studying?
   - What do we want to learn?
   - Why does it matter?

3. **Warm-up Exercise:**
   - Pair share: "Tell about a time when you felt truly understood by a product or service"
   - Debrief: What made that experience empathetic?

### 2. Data Immersion (45 min)

#### If you have research data:
1. **Data Gallery Walk**
   - Post all research artifacts on walls
   - Interview transcripts
   - Observation notes
   - Photos/videos
   - Survey results

2. **Silent Review** (15 min)
   - Participants review all materials
   - Take notes on sticky notes
   - Mark surprising findings with stars

3. **Share Discoveries** (30 min)
   - Round-robin sharing of key observations
   - Cluster similar findings
   - Identify patterns

#### If conducting live research:
1. **User Interview/Observation**
   - Bring user into session (or go to them)
   - Team observes and takes notes
   - Designated interviewer leads
   - Others capture observations silently

2. **Immediate Debrief**
   - What did we hear?
   - What did we see?
   - What surprised us?
   - What questions remain?

### 3. Empathy Mapping (45 min)

#### Setup
Create large empathy map on wall with four quadrants:
- Says & Does
- Thinks & Feels
- Hears
- Sees
Plus: Pains (bottom) and Gains (top)

#### Process
1. **Individual Contribution** (10 min)
   - Write observations on sticky notes
   - One thought per note
   - Use different colors for different users

2. **Collaborative Mapping** (25 min)
   - Place notes in appropriate quadrants
   - Discuss placement
   - Add new insights as they emerge
   - Look for tensions/contradictions

3. **Pain & Gain Identification** (10 min)
   - What frustrates users?
   - What are they trying to achieve?
   - What would delight them?

### 4. Journey Mapping (45 min)

#### Setup
Create timeline of user experience with key stages

#### Process
1. **Define Stages** (10 min)
   - Map the user's process/journey
   - Identify key moments
   - Create swim lanes for:
     - Actions
     - Thoughts
     - Emotions
     - Touchpoints
     - Pain points
     - Opportunities

2. **Populate Journey** (25 min)
   - Add details to each stage
   - Use research data as evidence
   - Mark emotional highs and lows
   - Identify breakdown points

3. **Opportunity Spotting** (10 min)
   - Where can we improve experience?
   - What moments matter most?
   - Where are biggest pain points?

### 5. Insight Generation (30 min)

#### Insight Mining
1. **Pattern Recognition** (10 min)
   - What patterns do we see?
   - What's consistent across users?
   - What contradictions exist?

2. **Insight Statements** (15 min)
   Format: "[User] needs [need] because [insight]"

   Examples:
   - "Parents need quick dinner solutions because they value family time over cooking time"
   - "Remote workers need boundary-setting tools because home and work spaces have merged"

3. **Prioritization** (5 min)
   - Vote on most important insights
   - Identify top 3-5 to pursue

### 6. Closing & Next Steps (15 min)

#### Synthesis
1. **Key Takeaways**
   - What are our biggest learnings?
   - What surprised us most?
   - What do we still need to learn?

2. **Action Items**
   - Additional research needed?
   - Problem statements to develop?
   - Stakeholders to brief?

3. **Documentation**
   - Photograph all artifacts
   - Assign documentation owner
   - Set follow-up meeting

## Facilitation Tips

### Energy Management
- Take breaks every hour
- Vary sitting and standing activities
- Use energizers if energy drops
- Play background music during individual work

### Inclusion Techniques
- Use silent brainstorming for introverts
- Rotate who speaks first
- Anonymous option for sensitive topics
- Multiple modalities (write, draw, speak)

### Common Challenges

#### Challenge: Jumping to Solutions
**Response:** "Great idea! Let's capture that for our ideation session. Right now, let's focus on understanding the problem."

#### Challenge: Assumptions Stated as Facts
**Response:** "Interesting hypothesis! What evidence do we have for that? Let's mark it as something to validate."

#### Challenge: Dominant Voices
**Response:** Use structured activities, silent work, and explicit turn-taking

#### Challenge: Sparse Data
**Response:** Note gaps as research needs, use "what if" scenarios carefully
