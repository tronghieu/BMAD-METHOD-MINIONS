# Task: Create Paper Prototype

**Design Thinking Phase**: Prototype
**Duration**: 1-4 hours
**Agent**: Prototype Builder
**Difficulty**: Low

## Purpose

Create a low-fidelity, tangible representation using paper, markers, and simple materials to test concepts quickly and cheaply.

## Prerequisites

- [ ] Concept sketches available
- [ ] Key user flows identified
- [ ] Materials ready (paper, markers, scissors, tape, sticky notes)

## Materials Needed

- Blank paper (letter/A4 size)
- Index cards or sticky notes
- Markers (black, colors for highlights)
- Scissors and tape
- Clear sheet protectors (optional, for reusability)

## Step-by-Step Process

### Phase 1: Sketch Key Screens (30-60 min)

**For each main screen**:
1. Draw screen outline on paper
2. Sketch main elements (boxes for content areas)
3. Label interactive elements (buttons, links, inputs)
4. Keep it rough - stick figures are fine
5. One screen per paper

**Elements to include**:
- Navigation (header, menu)
- Content areas (use squiggles for text)
- Interactive elements (buttons, forms)
- Images (draw X in box)

### Phase 2: Create Interaction Elements (15-30 min)

**Make moveable pieces**:
- Pop-up dialogs (separate papers)
- Drop-down menus (flaps or overlays)
- Error messages (sticky notes)
- Loading states (separate cards)
- Form inputs (write-on sticky notes)

### Phase 3: Map User Flow (15-30 min)

**Arrange screens**:
1. Lay out screens in sequence
2. Note transitions between screens
3. Mark what triggers each transition
4. Identify branches (different paths)

**Create flow map**:
```
[Home] --tap search--> [Search] --select--> [Details]
                          |
                      type query
                          |
                      [Results]
```

### Phase 4: Internal Test (15-30 min)

**Walk through with team**:
1. Simulate user actions
2. "Tap" on elements
3. Swap screens as if navigating
4. Identify missing screens
5. Note confusing moments
6. Add/adjust as needed

**Practice operating the prototype**:
- One person is the "computer"
- They swap papers/elements in response to user actions
- Practice smooth transitions

## Tips for Paper Prototyping

**Do**:
- ✅ Keep it rough and fast
- ✅ Label everything clearly
- ✅ Make extras (screens get worn)
- ✅ Number screens for reference
- ✅ Test internally first

**Don't**:
- ❌ Spend time on perfect drawings
- ❌ Try to prototype every edge case
- ❌ Make it too detailed
- ❌ Forget to plan how to "operate" it

## Expected Outputs

1. **Screen Set**: 5-15 paper screens
2. **Interactive Elements**: Moveable pieces (dialogs, menus)
3. **Flow Documentation**: Screen sequence notes
4. **Test Scenarios**: 2-3 tasks for users to attempt

## Success Indicators

✅ **Covers key flows**: Main user paths represented
✅ **Testable**: Users can interact meaningfully
✅ **Fast**: Built in time budget (1-4 hours)
✅ **Clear**: Team knows how to operate it
