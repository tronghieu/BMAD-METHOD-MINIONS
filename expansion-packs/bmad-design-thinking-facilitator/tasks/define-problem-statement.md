# Task: Define Problem Statement

**Design Thinking Phase**: Define
**Duration**: 2-4 hours (workshop format) or 2-3 days (iterative)
**Agent**: Problem Definer
**Difficulty**: Medium

## Purpose

Transform empathy research insights into a clear, actionable problem statement that guides ideation. This task bridges Empathize and Ideate phases by synthesizing user needs into focused "How Might We" (HMW) questions.

## Prerequisites

- [ ] **Completed user research** (interviews, observations, synthesis)
- [ ] **Empathy maps created** (user thoughts, feelings, behaviors)
- [ ] **Personas developed** (representative user archetypes)
- [ ] **Journey maps** (current-state user experience)
- [ ] **Key insights identified** (10-20 research findings)
- [ ] **Stakeholders available** (for validation and alignment)

## Step-by-Step Process

### Phase 1: Insight Synthesis (30-60 minutes)

#### 1.1 Review Research Findings

Gather team to review:
- All empathy research outputs
- Personas and their needs
- Journey map pain points
- Patterns across users
- Surprising insights

**Activity**: Gallery walk of research artifacts

#### 1.2 Identify Core User Needs

Transform observations into needs:

**Observation → Need Framework**:
- "Users email files to themselves" → Need for simple, trusted file transfer
- "Users skip onboarding" → Need for immediate value without setup
- "Users ask colleagues for help" → Need for intuitive, self-explanatory interface

**Output**: List of 10-15 core user needs

#### 1.3 Prioritize Needs

Use criteria to focus:
- **Impact**: How much does solving this improve user experience?
- **Frequency**: How often do users encounter this?
- **Intensity**: How painful is this problem?
- **Alignment**: Does this fit business goals?

**Method**: Dot voting or impact/frequency matrix
**Output**: Top 3-5 priority needs

### Phase 2: Craft Problem Statements (45-90 minutes)

#### 2.1 Point-of-View (POV) Statement

Use formula:
```
[User] needs [need] because [insight]
```

**Examples**:
- "Busy professionals need quick file sharing because they work across devices and lack time for complex tools"
- "Non-technical users need confidence during onboarding because past experiences have made them fearful of breaking things"

Create 3-5 POV statements for different needs/personas

#### 2.2 Problem Statement Criteria

A good problem statement is:
- ✅ **User-centered**: Focuses on user, not business
- ✅ **Broad enough**: Allows multiple solutions
- ✅ **Narrow enough**: Provides clear direction
- ✅ **Insight-driven**: Based on research, not assumptions
- ✅ **Inspiring**: Motivates team to solve
- ✅ **Non-prescriptive**: Doesn't include the solution

**Test each statement**:
- ❌ "We need to build a mobile app" (includes solution)
- ✅ "Users need access on-the-go because they work from multiple locations"

### Phase 3: Generate HMW Questions (30-60 minutes)

#### 3.1 Transform POVs into HMW Questions

Formula:
```
How Might We [achieve need] for [user] in [context]?
```

**From POV to HMW**:
- POV: "Busy professionals need quick file sharing because they work across devices"
- HMW: "How might we enable instant file access across devices without setup?"

**Generate multiple HMWs** per POV (aim for 15-30 total):
- Different scopes (broad vs narrow)
- Different angles (technology, process, behavior)
- Provocative variations

#### 3.2 HMW Question Variations

Use techniques to expand:

**Amplify the good**:
- "How might we make file sharing delightful?"

**Remove the bad**:
- "How might we eliminate setup friction?"

**Explore opposites**:
- "How might we make complexity feel simple?"

**Question assumptions**:
- "How might we help users without them asking?"

**Go analogical**:
- "How might we make file sharing as easy as texting?"

**Change a status quo**:
- "How might we make users experts from day one?"

#### 3.3 Refine and Select HMWs

Review all HMW questions and assess:
- **Too broad?**: "HMW improve productivity?" (everything!)
- **Too narrow?**: "HMW change button color?" (trivial)
- **Just right**: "HMW reduce time to first value under 60 seconds?"

**Selection criteria**:
- Actionable for ideation
- Based on research insights
- Exciting to solve
- Achievable scope
- Multiple solution paths possible

**Output**: 3-5 final HMW questions for ideation

### Phase 4: Validate & Align (30-45 minutes)

#### 4.1 Test with Research

Check HMWs against:
- Original user quotes (does this address what they said?)
- Personas (would Sarah care about this?)
- Journey map pain points (does this solve real friction?)

#### 4.2 Stakeholder Review

Present to stakeholders:
1. Research summary (key insights)
2. POV statements
3. HMW questions
4. Rationale for focus

Get alignment on:
- Are these the right problems?
- Which HMW to prioritize?
- Any constraints to add?

#### 4.3 Define Success Metrics

For each HMW, specify:
- **How will we measure success?**
  - Reduced time to complete task
  - Increased user satisfaction score
  - Higher activation rate
  - Fewer support tickets

- **What does "good enough" look like?**
  - Specific targets (e.g., "under 2 minutes")

**Output**: Clear success criteria for each HMW

## Expected Outputs

1. **Synthesis of User Needs**: 10-15 core needs identified
2. **POV Statements**: 3-5 user-centered problem frames
3. **HMW Questions**: 15-30 generated, 3-5 selected for ideation
4. **Success Metrics**: Measurable outcomes for each HMW
5. **Problem Brief**: 1-2 page document summarizing problem definition
6. **Stakeholder Alignment**: Approved direction for ideation

## Common Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge: "Too many problems to focus on"

**Solutions**:
- Use prioritization matrix (impact vs feasibility)
- Start with one HMW, iterate to others later
- Combine related problems into broader HMW
- Time-box: Pick top problem and move forward

### Challenge: "Problem statement includes solution"

**Solutions**:
- Remove technology/approach words
- Ask "What need does that solve?" to go deeper
- Reframe around outcome, not method
- Test: "Could we solve this multiple ways?"

### Challenge: "HMWs are too vague/broad"

**Solutions**:
- Add context: "...for [specific user] when [specific situation]"
- Break into smaller HMWs
- Add constraint: "...without requiring [X]"
- Test: "Could I generate 10 different solutions to this?"

### Challenge: "Team disagrees on priority"

**Solutions**:
- Return to research data (what did users say most?)
- Vote on criteria (impact, feasibility, etc.)
- Run parallel ideation on top 2-3 HMWs
- Let data decide, not opinions

## Success Indicators

✅ **Clear focus**: Team can articulate problem in one sentence
✅ **Research-grounded**: Based on actual user needs, not assumptions
✅ **Inspiring**: Team excited to solve this
✅ **Actionable**: Can immediately start generating solutions
✅ **Measurable**: Know how to evaluate success
✅ **Aligned**: Stakeholders support focus area
