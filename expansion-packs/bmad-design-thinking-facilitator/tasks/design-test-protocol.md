# Task: Design Test Protocol

**Design Thinking Phase**: Test
**Duration**: 30-60 minutes
**Agent**: Test Analyst
**Difficulty**: Medium

## Purpose

Create a structured testing plan that defines objectives, methods, participants, and procedures for validating prototypes with real users.

## Prerequisites

- [ ] Prototype ready for testing
- [ ] Testing objectives identified
- [ ] Target users defined

## Protocol Components

### 1. Testing Objectives (10 min)

**Define what we need to learn**:
- Can users complete core tasks?
- Do they understand the value proposition?
- Where do they get confused?
- What delights or frustrates them?
- Would they use/recommend this?

**Prioritize** 3-5 key questions

### 2. Participant Criteria (5 min)

**Who should we test with**:
- User segment/persona
- Required characteristics
- Exclusions (who NOT to test)
- Sample size (5-8 users minimum)

**Example**:
```
Target Participants:
- Small business owners
- 25-55 years old
- Currently use spreadsheets for tracking
- Not tech experts
- Never used our product before

Sample Size: 8 users
```

### 3. Test Method Selection (5 min)

**Choose approach**:
- **Moderated in-person**: Live observation, deep insights
- **Moderated remote**: Video call, wider reach
- **Unmoderated remote**: Async, larger scale, less depth

**Session Length**: 45-60 minutes typical

### 4. Session Structure (15-20 min)

**Create timeline**:

```
0:00-0:05 Welcome & Context
- Build rapport
- Explain process
- Get consent
- Set expectations

0:05-0:08 Think-Aloud Training
- Demonstrate narrating thoughts
- Practice with simple task

0:08-0:40 Task Scenarios
- Present 3-5 scenarios
- Observe without helping
- Take notes
- Probe after completion

0:40-0:50 Debrief Questions
- Overall impressions
- Likes/dislikes
- Comparison to current solution
- Likelihood to use

0:50-0:55 Wrap-up
- Thank participant
- Provide compensation
```

### 5. Observation Guide (10-15 min)

**What to observe**:
- Where users click/tap
- Hesitations and pauses
- Facial expressions
- Verbal reactions
- Errors and recovery
- Time to complete

**Note template**:
```
Scenario: [Name]
Start time: [00:00]

[00:02] User clicked X, expected Y
[00:05] [CONFUSION] "Where do I...?"
[00:08] [SUCCESS] Completed task
Time: 8 minutes

Observations:
- Struggled to find [feature]
- Positive reaction to [element]
```

### 6. Questions to Ask (5-10 min)

**During tasks** (minimal):
- "What are you thinking?"
- "What were you expecting?"
- "Why did you click there?"

**After tasks**:
- "Overall, what did you think?"
- "What worked well?"
- "What was frustrating?"
- "How does this compare to [current solution]?"
- "Would you use this? Why/why not?"
