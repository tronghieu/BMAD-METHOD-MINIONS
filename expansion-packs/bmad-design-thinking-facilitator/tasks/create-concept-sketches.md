# Task: Create Concept Sketches

**Design Thinking Phase**: Ideate → Prototype (Bridge)
**Duration**: 30-60 minutes
**Agent**: Ideation Coach
**Difficulty**: Low-Medium

## Purpose

Transform selected ideas from words into visual concepts through quick sketches and storyboards, preparing for prototyping phase.

## Prerequisites

- [ ] 3-5 top ideas selected
- [ ] Paper and markers/pens ready
- [ ] Team or individual sketchers
- [ ] Concept template (optional)

## Sketching Mindset

**Remember**:
- This is NOT about artistic skill
- Stick figures are perfect
- Boxes and arrows work great
- Focus on communicating concept, not beauty

**Goal**: Make ideas tangible and discussable

## Step-by-Step Process

### Phase 1: Concept Development (10-15 minutes per idea)

#### For Each Selected Idea

**Develop concept details**:

1. **Name the Concept**
   - Catchy, memorable name
   - Example: "Setup Sidekick" or "Instant Onboard"

2. **One-Sentence Description**
   - What is it?
   - Example: "An AI assistant that guides users through setup with personalized tips"

3. **Key Features** (3-5)
   - What does it do?
   - Example:
     - Real-time guidance
     - Contextual help bubbles
     - Progress tracking
     - Celebration moments

4. **User Benefits** (3-5)
   - How does it help? (Not just features!)
   - Example:
     - Completes setup 5x faster
     - Feels confident, not confused
     - Sees value immediately

5. **How It Works** (Basic flow)
   - Main steps or process
   - Example:
     - User lands on page
     - Assistant greets and offers help
     - Guides through each step
     - Celebrates completion

### Phase 2: Create Visual Sketches (20-40 minutes)

#### Sketch Type 1: Interface Sketch

**Show what the user sees**

**Elements to include**:
- Screen layout (basic rectangles)
- Key UI elements (buttons, menus)
- Content areas (use squiggles for text)
- User actions (arrows)

**Example for mobile app**:
```
┌─────────────┐
│  [Logo]     │
│             │
│ Welcome!    │
│ Let's get   │
│ started     │
│             │
│ [Profile    │
│  photo area]│
│             │
│ [Continue]  │
└─────────────┘
```

**Tools**:
- Pen/pencil and paper
- Whiteboard
- Digital tools (tablet, Figma, etc.)

#### Sketch Type 2: User Journey Storyboard

**Show experience over time** (comic strip style)

**Format**: 4-6 panels showing:

**Panel 1: Setup**
- User in initial state
- Shows pain point or need

**Panel 2: Discovery**
- User encounters solution
- First interaction

**Panel 3: Use**
- User engaging with concept
- Key features in action

**Panel 4: Benefit**
- User achieving goal
- Improved outcome
- Happy user!

**Example Sketch**:
```
┌────────┬────────┬────────┬────────┐
│ Panel 1│ Panel 2│ Panel 3│ Panel 4│
│        │        │        │        │
│ User   │ Finds  │ Uses   │ Success│
│ stuck  │ helper │ feature│ achieved
│ [sad]  │ [!]    │ [→]    │ [smile]│
└────────┴────────┴────────┴────────┘
```

#### Sketch Type 3: Concept Poster

**One-page visual summary**

**Template**:
```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│  [CONCEPT NAME]                 │
│  "Tagline"                      │
├─────────────────────────────────┤
│  [Simple Illustration/Sketch]   │
│                                 │
│  Key Features:                  │
│  • Feature 1                    │
│  • Feature 2                    │
│  • Feature 3                    │
│                                 │
│  Benefits:                      │
│  ✓ Benefit 1                    │
│  ✓ Benefit 2                    │
│                                 │
│  [How it works - 3 steps]       │
│  1 → 2 → 3                      │
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Phase 3: Add Context and Details (5-10 minutes)

**Annotate sketches with**:

**Labels**:
- Name elements
- Explain interactions
- Note transitions

**Call-outs**:
- "User taps here"
- "System responds with..."
- "This expands to show..."

**Notes**:
- Technical considerations
- Open questions
- Alternative approaches

**Example Annotations**:
```
[Button]  ← Tapping here
          ↓
    [Modal appears]
    "Are you sure?"
    [Yes] [No]
          ↓
    [Confirmation]
```

## Sketching Techniques

### Basic Elements Library

**People**:
- Stick figures ✓
- Circle head + line body ✓
- Emotions: ☹️ 😐 ☺️

**Screens/Devices**:
- Rectangle = screen
- Rounded rectangle = mobile
- With stand = desktop

**Actions**:
- Arrows (→) = flow/movement
- Starburst (*) = attention/click
- Dotted line = behind scenes

**Content**:
- Squiggles = text
- X in box = image
- Lines = list items

### Quick Sketch Methods

**6-Panel Story**:
1. Before (problem)
2. Trigger (discovers solution)
3. First use (tries it)
4. Aha moment (gets it!)
5. Repeat use (habit forms)
6. Success state (goal achieved)

**Crazy 8s for Concepts**:
- Fold paper into 8 sections
- 1 minute per section
- Sketch different angles of same concept
- Explore variations quickly

## Expected Outputs

1. **Concept Sketches**: 1-3 sketches per selected idea
2. **Storyboards**: User journey visualization (4-6 panels)
3. **Concept Posters**: One-page summaries
4. **Annotations**: Notes and explanations
5. **Photos**: Documentation of all sketches

## Common Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge: "I can't draw!"

**Solutions**:
- Use basic shapes only (circles, rectangles, arrows)
- Stick figures are perfect
- Label everything
- Focus on communication, not art
- Use templates/wireframe kits

### Challenge: "Concept is too complex to sketch"

**Solutions**:
- Sketch just the core interaction
- Break into multiple sketches (sequence)
- Focus on "happy path" only
- Use annotations for complexity

### Challenge: "Not sure what to sketch"

**Solutions**:
- Start with user (stick figure)
- Add their problem (thought bubble)
- Show solution appearing
- End with happy user
- Fill in middle steps

## Success Indicators

✅ **Visual**: Ideas communicated through images
✅ **Clear**: Anyone can understand concept from sketch
✅ **Complete**: Key features and flow shown
✅ **Discussable**: Sketches enable conversation
✅ **Diverse**: Multiple angles of each concept
✅ **Ready**: Team can start prototyping from these

## Tips

**Do**:
- ✅ Sketch quickly (5-10 min per concept)
- ✅ Use simple shapes
- ✅ Label everything
- ✅ Show user in the sketch
- ✅ Create multiple variations

**Don't**:
- ❌ Spend time on perfect art
- ❌ Erase and redo constantly
- ❌ Skip annotations
- ❌ Make it too detailed
- ❌ Draw without user in mind

**Remember**: Good enough to discuss and prototype is the goal!

## Next Steps

After sketching:
→ Use sketches to guide prototyping
→ Share with stakeholders for feedback
→ Begin `build-rapid-prototype.md` phase
