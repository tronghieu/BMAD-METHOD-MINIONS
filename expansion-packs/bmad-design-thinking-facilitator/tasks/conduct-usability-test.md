# Task: Conduct Usability Test

**Design Thinking Phase**: Test
**Duration**: 50-60 minutes per session
**Agent**: Test Analyst
**Difficulty**: Medium

## Purpose

Facilitate a user testing session to observe how real users interact with the prototype and gather actionable feedback.

## Prerequisites

- [ ] Prototype ready
- [ ] Test protocol prepared
- [ ] Participant confirmed
- [ ] Recording equipment tested
- [ ] Observation template ready

## Session Structure

### Pre-Session Setup (10 min before)

**Prepare**:
- Test recording equipment
- Load prototype
- Print/open observation template
- Have consent form ready
- Remove distractions

### Welcome & Context (5 min)

**Script**:
"Thank you for coming! Today you'll try a prototype and share your thoughts. We're testing the design, not you - there are no wrong answers. Your honest feedback helps us improve.

We'll record this session [audio/video] to review later. Everything is confidential. You can stop anytime. Sound good?"

**Get consent**: Signed form or verbal agreement (if recording)

### Think-Aloud Training (3 min)

**Explain**:
"As you use the prototype, please say what you're thinking out loud. For example..."

**Demonstrate**: Show simple task while narrating
"Okay, I see a search box. I'm wondering what I can search for. I'll type 'shoes'... I'm expecting to see shoe results..."

**Practice**: Have them try simple task with think-aloud

### Task Scenarios (30-40 min)

**For each scenario** (10-12 min each):

1. **Present scenario** (1 min)
   - Read context and goal
   - Answer clarifying questions
   - Don't explain how to do it

2. **Observe silently** (5-8 min)
   - Watch where they click/tap
   - Note hesitations
   - Record facial expressions
   - Listen to verbal reactions
   - Time the task

3. **Minimal intervention**
   - Let them struggle briefly (30-60 sec)
   - Only help if completely stuck
   - "What are you thinking?" to prompt think-aloud

4. **Probe after completion** (2-3 min)
   - "What were you expecting to happen?"
   - "What were you looking for?"
   - "Why did you click there?"

**What to capture**:
```
[00:02] Started task
[00:05] [CONFUSION] "Where is the...?"
[00:08] Clicked wrong button
[00:12] [FRUSTRATION] Sigh, tried again
[00:15] [SUCCESS] Completed
Time: 15 min (expected 5 min)

Quote: "I wish this was more obvious"
```

### Debrief Questions (10-15 min)

**Ask**:
- "Overall, what did you think?"
- "What worked well for you?"
- "What was frustrating?"
- "How does this compare to [what you use now]?"
- "On a scale of 1-10, how easy was this to use?"
- "Would you use this? Why/why not?"
- "What would make this better?"

### Closing (2 min)

- Thank them genuinely
- Explain next steps (if any)
- Provide compensation
- Invite additional feedback later

## Facilitation Best Practices

### Do:
- ✅ Stay neutral (no leading questions)
- ✅ Observe behavior over words
- ✅ Let silence happen (gives them time to think)
- ✅ Take detailed notes
- ✅ Probe confusing moments after

### Don't:
- ❌ Explain how things work
- ❌ Defend the design
- ❌ Help immediately when stuck
- ❌ Ask leading questions
- ❌ Make them feel bad for "failing"

### When They're Stuck

**After 30-60 seconds**:
- "What are you thinking right now?"
- "What would you expect to see/do?"

**If truly blocked**:
- "Let's assume [X] happened. What would you do next?"
- Give minimal hint to continue
- Note the blocker

## Note-Taking Template

```
PARTICIPANT: P[#] ([Name/ID], [age], [role])
DATE: [Date]
PROTOTYPE: [Version]

SCENARIO 1: [Name]
[00:00] [Note]
[00:05] [OBS] [Observation]
[00:10] [QUOTE] "User quote"
[00:15] [SUCCESS/FAIL]
Duration: [Time]
Issues: [List]

SCENARIO 2: [Name]
...

DEBRIEF NOTES:
- Overall impression: [Positive/Mixed/Negative]
- Ease rating: [#/10]
- Would use: [Yes/No/Maybe]
- Key quotes: ["...", "..."]

CRITICAL ISSUES:
1. [Blocker/confusion]
2. [Major frustration]

POSITIVE MOMENTS:
1. [What worked]
2. [User delight]
```

## Common Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge: "Participant not thinking aloud"

**Solutions**:
- Gentle reminders: "What's going through your mind?"
- Model it yourself occasionally
- Accept silence if they're concentrating

### Challenge: "Participant asks 'Am I doing this right?'"

**Response**:
- "There's no right or wrong - do what feels natural to you"
- "What would you do if I wasn't here?"

### Challenge: "Prototype breaks/doesn't work"

**Response**:
- "This is a prototype, that part doesn't work yet"
- "Let's assume that worked. What would you expect next?"
- Note the issue, continue

### Challenge: "Too polite, only positive feedback"

**Solutions**:
- Ask about specific moments: "I noticed you paused here - what happened?"
- Compare to alternatives: "How is this different from what you use now?"
- Focus on behavior (hesitations show problems)

## Expected Outputs

1. **Session Recording**: Audio/video file
2. **Detailed Notes**: Observations, quotes, timings
3. **Task Completion Data**: Success/fail, time taken
4. **Post-Session Summary**: Key takeaways (write within 1 hour)

## Success Indicators

✅ **Rich observations**: Detailed behavioral notes
✅ **Honest feedback**: User comfortable being candid
✅ **Complete scenarios**: All tasks attempted
✅ **Good data**: Can identify patterns and issues
✅ **Documented**: Notes and recordings captured
