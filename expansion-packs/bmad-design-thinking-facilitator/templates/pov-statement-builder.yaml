    type: structured-data
    instruction: |
      Context for problem framing:
      - Project name
      - Date created
      - Based on research from (date range, sources)
      - Team members involved in framing
      - Key personas addressed

  - id: research-foundation
    title: Research Foundation
    instruction: |
      Link to research that informs these POV statements:
      - Empathy research synthesis
      - User personas
      - Journey maps
      - Key insights
      - Stakeholder input

  - id: pov-statements
    title: Point of View Statements
    instruction: |
      Create POV statements using the formula:
      [User] needs [need] because [insight]

      Guidelines:
      - Be specific about the user (use persona names)
      - Focus on needs, not solutions
      - Ground in research insights
      - Make it meaningful (not trivial)
      - Keep it actionable
    sections:
      - id: pov-template
        title: "POV Statement {{number}}"
        repeatable: true
        instruction: Create 5-10 POV statements exploring different problem angles

            title: POV Statement
            type: template-text
            template: |
              {{user_persona}} needs {{need}} because {{insight}}
            instruction: |
              Complete the POV statement:
              - User: Which persona or user segment?
              - Need: What human need (verb-based)?
              - Insight: Why does this need exist (research-based)?

              Example: "Busy parents need quick, healthy meal solutions because
              they value quality family time over food preparation time"
            elicit: true

              - Persona name (if defined)
              - User segment description
              - Key characteristics relevant to this need
            elicit: true

            editors: [problem-definer]

          - id: need
            title: Need
            type: text
            instruction: |
              Articulate the need:
              - Use action verbs (do, accomplish, achieve)
              - Focus on the need, NOT the solution
              - Keep it human-centered
              - Make it specific enough to act on

              Good: "organize complex information quickly"
              Bad: "use a better app" (solution-focused)
            elicit: true

              - Context that makes this need important
              - Evidence from user research
              - What makes this meaningful

              This should reveal WHY the need exists
