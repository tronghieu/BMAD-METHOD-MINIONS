          Today we're testing [prototype/website/app] to see how it works
          for people like you. I want to emphasize a few things:

          - **We're testing the design, not you.** There are no wrong answers.
          - **Please think out loud** as you work. Tell me what you're thinking,
            what you're looking for, any confusion or frustration.
          - **Be honest!** You won't hurt our feelings. We want to know what
            really works and what doesn't.
          - **This is a prototype**, so some things might not work perfectly.
            That's okay and expected.
          - **Ask questions any time**, though I might not answer during tasks
            so we can see how you'd handle it naturally.

          Do you have any questions before we begin?"
