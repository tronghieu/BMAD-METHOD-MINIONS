    instruction: |
      A brief, high-level summary of the most critical outcomes.
      - What was the single most important thing we learned?
      - Was our primary hypothesis confirmed or refuted?
      - What is the top-priority recommendation for the next iteration?

  - id: hypotheses-validation
    title: Hypotheses Validation
    type: table
    columns: [Hypothesis, Result, Evidence, Confidence]
    instruction: |
      Review the hypotheses that this prototype was designed to test.

      | Hypothesis | Result | Evidence | Confidence |
      |------------|--------|----------|------------|
      | [Hypothesis 1] | ✓ Confirmed | [Quote or metric] | High |
      | [Hypothesis 2] | ✗ Refuted | [Observation] | High |
      | [Hypothesis 3] | ~ Inconclusive | [Mixed feedback] | Medium |

      - **Result**: ✓ Confirmed, ✗ Refuted, ~ Inconclusive
      - **Evidence**: The key data point (qualitative or quantitative) that proves the result.
      - **Confidence**: How certain are we of this conclusion?

        type: bullet-list
        instruction: |
          Identify the successes and moments of delight.
          - Which features were intuitive and well-received?
          - What parts of the flow were seamless?
          - What design elements resonated with users?
        template: |
          - [Successful element]: [Why it worked - e.g., "Users immediately understood the dashboard layout."]
        elicit: true

      - id: what-didnt-work
        title: What Didn't Work (Fix or Re-think)
        type: bullet-list
        instruction: |
          Identify the failures and pain points.
          - Where did users get stuck or confused?
          - What features were ignored or misunderstood?
          - What caused the most frustration?
        template: |
          - [Problem area]: [Description of the issue - e.g., "The checkout process was confusing for 4/5 users."]
        elicit: true

        editors: [test-analyst]

      - id: surprises
        title: Surprising Findings
        type: bullet-list
        instruction: |
          Document the unexpected observations.
          - What user behaviors did we not anticipate?
          - What feedback contradicted our assumptions?
          - Were there any creative or unintended uses of the prototype?
        template: |
          - [Surprising finding]: [Implication or question it raises]
        elicit: true

  - id: decision-making
    title: Decisions & Actions
    instruction: |
      Based on the learnings, decide on the next steps.
    sections:

        type: choice
        choices: [Pivot, Persevere, Iterate]
        instruction: |
          Based on the findings, what is the overall strategic decision?
          - **Pivot**: A fundamental change in direction is needed. Our core hypothesis was wrong.
          - **Persevere**: The core concept is validated. Proceed with minor changes.
          - **Iterate**: The concept is promising but needs significant refinement. Go back to the prototype/ideate phase.

          Decision: [Choose one]
          Rationale: [Justification for the decision]
        elicit: true
