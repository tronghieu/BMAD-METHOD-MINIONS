    title: HMW Question Principles
    instruction: |
      Good HMW questions are:
      - Optimistic (assume solutions exist)
      - Broad enough to explore (not too narrow)
      - Narrow enough to be actionable (not too broad)
      - Free from solutions (open to possibilities)
      - Inspiring (energize the team)

      Questions should start with "How might we..." and nothing else

    title: HMW Generation Techniques
    instruction: |
      Use these techniques to generate diverse HMW questions from your POV:

      1. **Amp up the Good**: How might we make positive aspects even better?
      2. **Remove the Bad**: How might we eliminate pain points?
      3. **Explore the Opposite**: How might we approach this from the reverse angle?
      4. **Question an Assumption**: How might we challenge our beliefs?
      5. **Go After Adjectives**: How might we change the quality (faster, easier, cheaper)?
      6. **Identify Unexpected Resources**: How might we leverage existing assets?
      7. **Create an Analogy**: How might we apply lessons from other domains?
      8. **Play with Prepositions**: Change "for" to "with," "from" to "by," etc.
      9. **Break It Down**: Focus on one aspect of the problem
      10. **Zoom Out**: Expand to the bigger picture
