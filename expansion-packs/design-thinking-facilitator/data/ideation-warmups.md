# Ideation Warmups & Creative Energizers

A collection of quick exercises to prime creative thinking, boost energy, and prepare teams for productive ideation sessions. These warmups break mental patterns, build psychological safety, and activate divergent thinking.

## How to Use These Warmups

- **Choose based on energy level**: Match warmup to team's current state
- **Keep it playful**: Fun and laughter unlock creativity
- **Time-box strictly**: Maintain energy with tight constraints
- **No judgment zone**: Model vulnerability by going first
- **Debrief quickly**: "What did you notice?" before main session

---

## Quick Energizers (2-5 minutes)

### 1. 30 Circles Challenge
**Purpose**: Activate rapid ideation and visual thinking

**Materials**: Paper with 30 empty circles printed (or quickly drawn)

**Process**:
1. Give everyone a sheet with 30 circles
2. Set timer for 3 minutes
3. Transform circles into recognizable objects (clock, sun, face, wheel...)
4. Count completions—celebrate quantity over quality
5. Share favorites with group

**Variations**:
- **Theme version**: All circles must relate to topic (e.g., "technology")
- **Collaborative**: Pass sheets every 30 seconds
- **Digital**: Use online whiteboard circles

**Debrief Questions**:
- "How many did you complete?"
- "Did you notice patterns in your thinking?"
- "What happened when time pressure increased?"

---

### 2. Alternative Uses
**Purpose**: Practice divergent thinking and challenge assumptions

**Object Examples**: Paperclip, brick, newspaper, coffee mug, rubber band

**Process**:
1. Present common object
2. Set 2-minute timer
3. Generate unusual uses (paperclip as lock pick, zipper pull, sculpture...)
4. Share most creative ideas
5. Count total—aim for 20+

**Facilitator Tips**:
- Start with "A paperclip can be used as..."
- Encourage absurd ideas: "Tiny javelin for ants!"
- Build on others: "Yes, and if it's a javelin, it could also be..."

**Quality Boosters**:
- "What if it was giant-sized?"
- "What if you had 10,000 of them?"
- "What would a child use it for?"

---

### 3. Mashup Machine
**Purpose**: Practice combinatorial creativity

**Process**:
1. Pick two random unrelated objects/concepts
2. Combine them into new invention
3. Name it and describe its purpose
4. Quick sketch (stick figures fine!)

**Example Combinations**:
- Umbrella + Bicycle = "Rain Rider" (covered bike for weather)
- Pizza + Alarm clock = "Pizza Time" (alerts when pizza ready)
- Tree + Computer = "Data Tree" (organic data visualization)

**Advanced Version**:
- Add third element mid-exercise
- Must solve specific problem with mashup
- Create tagline or jingle for invention

---

### 4. Superpower Solutions
**Purpose**: Remove real-world constraints and think big

**Superpowers List**:
- Telepathy
- Time travel
- Invisibility
- Super speed
- Mind reading
- Teleportation
- Shape-shifting
- X-ray vision

**Process**:
1. State the problem briefly
2. Assign random superpower to each person
3. "How would you solve this with [superpower]?"
4. 1 minute to think, 30 seconds to share
5. Extract practical ideas from super solutions

**Example**:
- Problem: "Long customer service wait times"
- Super speed: "Handle all requests instantly" → Automated instant responses
- Telepathy: "Know what they need before calling" → Predictive support

---

### 5. Word Association Lightning Round
**Purpose**: Loosen mental connections and activate creativity

**Process**:
1. Start with word related to challenge
2. Each person says first word that comes to mind
3. Next person associates to that word
4. Continue rapidly for 2 minutes
5. Map back surprising connections to problem

**Rules**:
- No thinking—first word only
- No judging or laughing
- Keep pace fast
- OK to repeat if stuck

**Variation - Category Jump**:
Every 5th word must be from specific category (food, animals, emotions)

---

## Medium Warmups (5-10 minutes)

### 6. Design the Worst
**Purpose**: Release perfectionism through intentional failure

**Process**:
1. Present design challenge
2. "Design the absolute worst solution possible"
3. 3 minutes to sketch/describe terrible approach
4. Present bad ideas with enthusiasm
5. Vote for "worst of the worst"
6. Reverse each bad element into good principle

**Why It Works**:
- Removes fear of judgment
- Often reveals what NOT to do
- Laughter relaxes creative thinking
- Bad ideas contain seeds of brilliance

**Example Challenge**: "Design worst coffee shop"
- Terrible coffee → Focus on exceptional quality
- Confusing menu → Crystal clear options

- Until finally...
- Ever since then...

**Process**:
1. Each person adds one line following structure
2. Must accept previous line (no blocking)
3. Build toward conclusion

## Deep Warmups (10-15 minutes)

### 11. Time Travel Design
**Purpose**: Escape current constraints by shifting temporal perspective

**Process**:
1. Split into three groups
2. Each designs solution for different era:
   - Group 1: 1920s (no computers)
   - Group 2: Today (current tech)
   - Group 3: 2074 (imagined tech)
3. Present solutions
4. Find timeless principles across all three

**Debrief**: "What stays constant across time?"

3. Silent gallery walk—add builds with sticky notes
4. Choose most interesting impossible idea
5. Work backward: "What would need to be true?"
6. Find stepping stones toward impossible

---

### 15. Role Reversal Scenarios
**Purpose**: Build empathy and see new angles

**Process**:
1. List key stakeholders in problem
2. Assign opposite roles to participants
   - CEO plays intern
   - Customer plays competitor
