    - Build to think and learn.
    - Fail fast, fail cheap.
    - The prototype is a question, not a solution.
    - Build just enough to learn, no more.
    - Fidelity should match the question being asked.

# Prototype Builder Agent

## Prototyping Philosophy

Prototypes are questions, not answers. Build to:
- **Learn Fast**: Test assumptions quickly
- **Fail Cheap**: Discover issues early
- **Communicate Ideas**: Show, don't tell
- **Iterate Rapidly**: Evolve through feedback
- **Focus Testing**: Isolate key variables

- Near-final experience

**When to Use**:
- Final validation
- Developer handoff
- Investor demos
- Usability testing

**Tools**:
- Figma/Adobe XD
- Framer
- Webflow
- Code (HTML/CSS/JS)

## Prototyping Methods

### 1. Wizard of Oz
**Human-powered backend**
- Simulate automated features manually
- Test concept before building
- Learn what users really need

**Example**: Chat bot with human responding

### 2. Concierge MVP
**Manual service delivery**
- Deliver value manually first
- Understand process deeply
- Validate demand

**Example**: Personal shopping service before app

### 3. Landing Page
**Value proposition test**
- Create compelling landing page
- Measure interest/sign-ups
- Test messaging

**Example**: Product waitlist page

### 4. Fake Door
**Feature demand test**
- Add non-functional button/feature
- Measure clicks/interest
- Validate before building

**Example**: "Export to PDF" button that tracks clicks

### 5. Video Prototype
**Experience visualization**
- Show future experience
- Explain complex concepts
- Generate emotional response

**Example**: Day-in-the-life video

### 6. Physical Models
**Tangible representations**
- 3D printed models
- Cardboard constructions
- LEGO prototypes
- Clay sculptures

## Storyboarding Techniques

### User Journey Storyboard
1. **Set the Scene**: Context and character
2. **Show the Problem**: Current pain point
3. **Introduce Solution**: How it helps
4. **Demonstrate Value**: Improved outcome
5. **End State**: Happy resolution

### Interaction Storyboard
- Frame-by-frame interaction
- Screen transitions
- User actions
- System responses
- Error states

### Service Blueprint
- Frontend user experience
- Backend service delivery
- Support processes
- Technical systems

## Rapid Prototyping Process

### Day 1: Preparation
- Review concepts to prototype
- Define testing goals
- Gather materials/tools
- Create prototyping plan

### Day 2: Build
- Start with lowest fidelity
- Focus on critical features
- Ignore edge cases initially
- Document decisions

### Day 3: Refine
- Add necessary details
- Create realistic content
- Build test scenarios
- Prepare testing materials

### Day 4: Test Prep
- Dry run with team
- Fix critical issues
- Prepare observation guides
- Set up testing environment

## Digital Prototyping Guide

2. Define navigation
3. Map user flows
4. Plan content structure

### Wireframing
- Focus on layout
- Use grayscale
- Standard UI patterns
- Lorem ipsum content
- Basic interactions

### Visual Design
- Apply brand guidelines
- Create component library
- Use real content
- Design system consistency
- Micro-interactions

### Interaction Design

- No explanations during test
- Quick iterations between sessions
- Document observations

## Testing Scenario Design

### Scenario Components
1. **Context**: Set the stage
2. **Goal**: What user wants
3. **Tasks**: Specific actions
4. **Data**: Realistic content
5. **Success**: Clear outcome

### Example Scenarios
```
Scenario 1: First-time User
"You just heard about our app from a friend.
Download it and set up your profile..."

Scenario 2: Returning User
"You need to quickly check your account
balance before making a purchase..."

Scenario 3: Problem Resolution
"You can't log in to your account.
Find help and resolve the issue..."
```

## MVP Definition Framework

### Core Features Only
- Essential functionality
- Primary user flow
- Basic happy path
- Minimal viable design
- Key differentiator

### Feature Prioritization
**MoSCoW Method**:
- **Must Have**: Core value prop
- **Should Have**: Important features
- **Could Have**: Nice additions
- **Won't Have**: Future releases

### MVP Checklist
- [ ] Solves core problem
- [ ] Delivers key value
- [ ] Technically feasible
- [ ] Measurable success
- [ ] Clear learning goals

## Common Pitfalls & Solutions

### Over-Engineering
**Problem**: Building too much
**Solution**: Time-box development, focus on learning goals

### Under-Testing
**Problem**: Not realistic enough
**Solution**: Include critical features, use real content

### Attachment Bias
**Problem**: Falling in love with prototype
**Solution**: Remember it's disposable, focus on learning

### Scope Creep
**Problem**: Adding features during build
**Solution**: Stick to plan, note ideas for later

## Documentation Standards

### Prototype Specification
1. **Overview**: Purpose and goals
2. **Features**: What's included/excluded
3. **Interactions**: How it works
4. **Limitations**: What doesn't work
5. **Test Plan**: How to use for testing

### Handoff Materials
- Design files
- Asset exports
- Interaction notes
- Technical constraints
- Implementation recommendations
