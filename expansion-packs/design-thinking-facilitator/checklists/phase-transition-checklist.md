# Phase Transition Checklist

Use this checklist to ensure you've completed one Design Thinking phase and are ready to transition to the next. Each phase builds on the previous, so completeness matters.

## Transitioning from Empathize → Define

### Empathize Phase Completion Checklist

- [ ] **Research conducted**: Completed 8-12 user interviews OR 5-8 observations
- [ ] **Diverse participants**: Mix of user types, experience levels, demographics
- [ ] **Rich data captured**: Quotes, photos, observed behaviors documented
- [ ] **Notes synthesized**: Affinity mapping or similar synthesis completed
- [ ] **Empathy maps created**: At least 2-3 for key user segments
- [ ] **Personas developed**: 2-4 representative user archetypes with needs/goals
- [ ] **Journey maps created**: Current-state user experience mapped
- [ ] **Insights identified**: 10-20 key findings from research
- [ ] **Patterns recognized**: Themes across multiple users
- [ ] **Stakeholders informed**: Research findings presented and accepted

### Ready for Define Phase When:

✅ Team has shared understanding of users
✅ Clear patterns emerged from research
✅ Surprising insights uncovered (not just confirming assumptions)
✅ Pain points well-documented
✅ User quotes/stories readily available

⚠️ **Not ready if**: Research feels surface-level, no clear patterns, team still assuming vs knowing

---

## Transitioning from Define → Ideate

### Define Phase Completion Checklist

- [ ] **Insights synthesized**: Research transformed into actionable insights
- [ ] **User needs prioritized**: Know which needs to focus on
- [ ] **POV statements crafted**: 3-5 point-of-view statements created
- [ ] **HMW questions generated**: 15-30 How Might We questions created
- [ ] **HMWs refined**: Selected 3-5 focused HMWs for ideation
- [ ] **Problem framed user-centered**: Focused on user need, not business goal
- [ ] **Success metrics defined**: Know how to measure if solution works
- [ ] **Stakeholder alignment**: Agreement on problem focus
- [ ] **Problem brief documented**: 1-2 pages capturing problem definition
- [ ] **Non-prescriptive**: Problem doesn't include the solution

### Ready for Ideate Phase When:

✅ HMW questions are inspiring and actionable
✅ Team agrees on problem to solve
✅ Problem broad enough for multiple solutions
✅ Problem narrow enough to make progress
✅ Clear what success looks like

⚠️ **Not ready if**: Problem too vague, includes solution, no team alignment, unclear scope

---

## Transitioning from Ideate → Prototype

### Ideate Phase Completion Checklist

- [ ] **Ideas generated**: 50-100+ raw ideas captured
- [ ] **Diverse solutions**: Multiple approaches explored, not all similar
- [ ] **Wild ideas included**: Some unconventional/bold concepts emerged
- [ ] **Ideas clustered**: Organized into themes/categories
- [ ] **Evaluation criteria used**: Clear method for selection (voting, matrix, etc.)
- [ ] **Top concepts selected**: 3-5 ideas chosen for prototyping
- [ ] **Concepts developed**: Selected ideas have descriptions, sketches, rationale
- [ ] **Assumptions documented**: Know what each concept assumes to be true
- [ ] **Testing plan drafted**: Know what to test and how
- [ ] **Selection rationale**: Can explain why these concepts were chosen

### Ready for Prototype Phase When:

✅ Clear concepts to build (not vague ideas)
✅ Team excited about selected solutions
✅ Variety of concepts (mix of safe and bold)
✅ Testable assumptions identified
✅ Know what fidelity needed for testing

⚠️ **Not ready if**: Ideas too similar, concepts vague, unclear what to test, no enthusiasm

---

## Transitioning from Prototype → Test

### Prototype Phase Completion Checklist

- [ ] **Prototypes built**: 1-3 tangible artifacts created
- [ ] **Appropriate fidelity**: Level matches testing needs (paper/digital/functional)
- [ ] **Core flows work**: Can demonstrate key user interactions
- [ ] **Realistic enough**: Users can meaningfully interact
- [ ] **Multiple concepts** (if comparing): All at same fidelity level
- [ ] **Testing scenarios written**: 3-5 realistic tasks for users
- [ ] **Assumptions list**: Know what each prototype tests
- [ ] **Discussion guide ready**: Questions prepared for user feedback
- [ ] **Team practiced**: Internal walkthrough completed
- [ ] **Documentation**: Photos/screenshots of prototypes captured

### Ready for Test Phase When:

✅ Prototype demonstrates core value proposition
✅ Key user flows functional (can be simulated)
✅ Good enough to get meaningful feedback
✅ Team knows how to "operate" prototype in test
✅ Clear hypotheses to validate

⚠️ **Not ready if**: Prototype too polished (wasted time), too rough (can't test), missing key flows

## Transitioning from Test → Iterate or Implement

### Test Phase Completion Checklist

- [ ] **Users tested**: 5-8 participants completed testing
- [ ] **Sessions documented**: Notes, videos, observations captured
- [ ] **Patterns identified**: Common issues across users (3+)
- [ ] **Severity assessed**: Issues rated (critical/high/medium/low)
- [ ] **Successes noted**: What worked well documented
- [ ] **Insights synthesized**: Observations transformed into insights
- [ ] **Metrics captured**: Completion rates, time, errors, satisfaction
- [ ] **Video clips**: Key moments clipped (10-15 seconds each)
- [ ] **Findings report**: Documented results with evidence
- [ ] **Recommendations prioritized**: Know what to change first

### Decision: Iterate or Implement?

**Iterate (go back to Prototype or Ideate)** if:
- [ ] Critical usability issues found (task blockers)
- [ ] Users don't understand core value
- [ ] Task completion rate <70%
- [ ] Negative overall sentiment
- [ ] Core assumption invalidated
- [ ] Better direction discovered

**Implement (move to development)** if:
- [ ] Task completion rate >80%
- [ ] Users understand and value solution
- [ ] Positive overall sentiment
- [ ] Issues are minor/polish-level
- [ ] Core assumptions validated
- [ ] Clear path to development

**Partially Iterate** (common):
- [ ] Keep successful elements
- [ ] Redesign problematic flows
- [ ] Test again focused on changes
- [ ] Iterative improvement cycle

## Universal Quality Gates (All Phases)

Before transitioning from ANY phase, ensure:

### Documentation

- [ ] **Outputs captured**: Photos, digital files, notes saved
- [ ] **Decisions documented**: Why we chose this direction
- [ ] **Next steps clear**: Team knows what happens next
- [ ] **Files organized**: Easy to find for next phase

### Team Alignment

- [ ] **Shared understanding**: Team has common view of progress
- [ ] **Stakeholder buy-in**: Leadership supports direction
- [ ] **Resources confirmed**: Budget/time for next phase approved
- [ ] **Roles clear**: Who does what in next phase

### Quality

- [ ] **Grounded in research**: Based on evidence, not assumptions
- [ ] **User-centered**: Focused on user needs
- [ ] **Achievable scope**: Not too ambitious, not too small
- [ ] **Measurable**: Can assess if successful

### Energy & Momentum

- [ ] **Team energized**: Excitement about next phase
- [ ] **Learning mindset**: Open to discovery
- [ ] **Time allocated**: Next phase scheduled
- [ ] **Quick transition**: Moving forward within days, not weeks

## Red Flags: Don't Transition If...

⚠️ **From Empathize**:
- Haven't talked to actual users (only stakeholders/team)
- No surprising insights (just confirmed assumptions)
- Can't articulate user needs clearly

⚠️ **From Define**:
- Problem statement includes the solution
- Team doesn't agree on focus
- No clear success criteria

⚠️ **From Ideate**:
- Generated <30 ideas (too little exploration)
- All ideas similar (not enough diversity)
- No team conviction about concepts

⚠️ **From Prototype**:
- Can't demonstrate key interaction
- Prototype blocks meaningful testing
- Unclear what to learn from testing

⚠️ **From Test**:
- Tested <5 users (not enough data)
- No clear patterns (every user different)
- Don't know what to change

## Checkpoint Questions

Ask these before transitioning:

1. **Completeness**: "Did we accomplish this phase's objective?"
2. **Quality**: "Is our work grounded in evidence and user-centered?"
3. **Clarity**: "Do we know exactly what to do next?"
4. **Alignment**: "Does the team agree we're ready?"
5. **Resources**: "Do we have what we need for the next phase?"

If you answer "no" to any, pause and address gaps before moving forward.

**Remember**: Design Thinking is iterative—it's okay to loop back. Better to cycle quickly between phases than force linear progression with incomplete work.
