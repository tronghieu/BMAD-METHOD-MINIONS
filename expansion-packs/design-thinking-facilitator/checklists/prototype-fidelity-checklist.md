# Prototype Fidelity Selection Checklist

Use this checklist to choose the appropriate fidelity level for your prototypes based on what you need to learn, available resources, and project stage.

## Decision Framework

Answer these questions to guide fidelity selection:

### Question 1: What Stage Are We In?

- [ ] **Early exploration** → Low fidelity (paper, sketches)
- [ ] **Refining concept** → Medium fidelity (clickable wireframes)
- [ ] **Final validation** → High fidelity (coded prototype)
- [ ] **Comparing multiple ideas** → Low fidelity for all

### Question 2: What Do We Need to Learn?

- [ ] **Core concept viability** → Low fidelity
- [ ] **User workflow/navigation** → Medium fidelity
- [ ] **Interaction details** → Medium-High fidelity
- [ ] **Visual design/branding** → High fidelity
- [ ] **Technical feasibility** → High fidelity (functional)
- [ ] **Service experience** → Role-play/physical mockup

### Question 3: How Much Time Do We Have?

- [ ] **< 4 hours** → Low fidelity only
- [ ] **4-24 hours** → Low or Medium fidelity
- [ ] **1-3 days** → Medium fidelity
- [ ] **3-7 days** → Medium-High fidelity
- [ ] **1-2 weeks** → High fidelity

### Question 4: How Uncertain Are We?

- [ ] **Very uncertain** (50/50 if it works) → Low fidelity
- [ ] **Moderately uncertain** (think it works, need validation) → Medium fidelity
- [ ] **Fairly confident** (fine-tuning) → High fidelity

### Question 5: How Many Concepts?

- [ ] **Testing 3+ concepts** → Low fidelity for all
- [ ] **Testing 2 concepts** → Low or Medium fidelity
- [ ] **Testing 1 concept** → Medium or High fidelity

## Fidelity Levels Defined

### Low Fidelity

**Characteristics**:
- Hand-drawn or basic shapes
- Black and white or minimal color
- Lorem ipsum or placeholder content
- Simulated interactions (manual)
- Rough, unfinished appearance

**Best for testing**:
- ✅ Core concept/value proposition
- ✅ Information architecture
- ✅ General user flow
- ✅ Screen-to-screen navigation
- ✅ Content priority

**Not good for testing**:
- ❌ Visual design aesthetics
- ❌ Detailed interactions
- ❌ Micr o-animations
- ❌ Branding/polish
- ❌ Technical performance

**Time**: 1-8 hours
**Cost**: Near $0 (paper/markers)
**Tools**: Paper, markers, PowerPoint

**Choose Low Fidelity When**:
- [ ] Early in design process
- [ ] High uncertainty about concept
- [ ] Multiple ideas to compare
- [ ] Limited time/budget
- [ ] Testing with friendly users

### Medium Fidelity

**Characteristics**:
- Digital wireframes or mockups
- Some real content (not all)
- Clickable/tappable interactions
- Basic visual hierarchy
- Grayscale or simple colors

**Best for testing**:
- ✅ Detailed user workflows
- ✅ Interactive elements (buttons, forms, menus)
- ✅ Navigation patterns
- ✅ Content comprehension
- ✅ Task completion

**Not good for testing**:
- ❌ Final visual design
- ❌ Branding decisions
- ❌ Complex animations
- ❌ Technical architecture

**Time**: 8-24 hours
**Cost**: Low (software subscriptions)
**Tools**: Figma, Adobe XD, Sketch, PowerPoint

**Choose Medium Fidelity When**:
- [ ] Concept validated, refining execution
- [ ] Need stakeholder buy-in
- [ ] Testing specific workflows
- [ ] Multiple iterations planned
- [ ] Remote usability testing

### High Fidelity

**Characteristics**:
- Polished visual design
- Real content and copy
- Functional interactions
- Brand colors/fonts/imagery
- Looks like final product

**Best for testing**:
- ✅ Final design validation
- ✅ Detailed usability
- ✅ Emotional response/desirability
- ✅ Branding/aesthetics
- ✅ Stakeholder/investor demos

**Not good for testing**:
- ❌ Core concept (may be too late)
- ❌ Multiple alternatives (too expensive)

**Time**: 2-10 days
**Cost**: Medium-High (time intensive)
**Tools**: Figma + prototyping, coded HTML/CSS, no-code builders

**Choose High Fidelity When**:
- [ ] Final validation before development
- [ ] Executive/investor presentation
- [ ] Testing desirability/brand fit
- [ ] Handoff to developers
- [ ] Marketing/sales materials

## Fidelity Selection Checklist

### Choose LOW Fidelity If:

- [ ] **Early exploration**: First time prototyping this concept
- [ ] **High uncertainty**: 50/50 if approach will work
- [ ] **Multiple concepts**: Need to compare 3+ ideas
- [ ] **Time-constrained**: Have <8 hours to build
- [ ] **Budget-limited**: Can't afford design tools/time
- [ ] **Concept-focused**: Testing core idea, not execution
- [ ] **Frequent changes**: Expect major iterations
- [ ] **Friendly testers**: Internal team or known users

### Choose MEDIUM Fidelity If:

- [ ] **Refining concept**: Core idea validated, improving execution
- [ ] **Workflow-focused**: Testing multi-step processes
- [ ] **Remote testing**: Need shareable digital prototype
- [ ] **Stakeholder review**: Need to present to leadership
- [ ] **Time available**: Have 8-24 hours to build
- [ ] **Iterative approach**: Plan multiple test rounds
- [ ] **Usability focus**: Testing task completion and navigation

### Choose HIGH Fidelity If:

- [ ] **Final validation**: Last check before development
- [ ] **Desirability testing**: Testing aesthetics and brand
- [ ] **External demo**: Showing to investors, press, partners
- [ ] **Handoff ready**: Developers need detailed specs
- [ ] **Time available**: Have 2+ days to build
- [ ] **Single concept**: Only testing one approach
- [ ] **Marketing needs**: Creating promotional materials

## Red Flags: Wrong Fidelity

### Too Low Fidelity When:

⚠️ **Don't use low fidelity if**:
- Testing final design details
- Need stakeholder approval for funding
- Validating visual brand direction
- Users need to feel "real" to give feedback
- Testing technical feasibility

### Too High Fidelity When:

⚠️ **Don't use high fidelity if**:
- Still exploring concepts
- Major changes likely
- Comparing multiple approaches
- Users might confuse with final product
- Team attached to polished work (hard to throw away)

---

## Multi-Fidelity Strategy

Sometimes use different fidelities for different purposes:

### Parallel Fidelities

- [ ] **Multiple concepts**: All concepts at SAME fidelity (fair comparison)
- [ ] **Different aspects**: Low for new features, high for existing

### Progressive Fidelity

Round 1: Low fidelity → Test 5 concepts → Select 2
Round 2: Medium fidelity → Test 2 concepts → Select 1
Round 3: High fidelity → Validate final design

---

## Special Cases

### For Service Design:

- [ ] **Role-play** (low fidelity): Act out service experience
- [ ] **Service prototypes** (medium): Props and scripted interactions
- [ ] **Pilot** (high): Run actual service with real customers

### For Physical Products:

- [ ] **Sketches** (low fidelity): 2D drawings
- [ ] **Cardboard mockups** (medium): 3D form and size
- [ ] **3D printed** (high): Functional prototype

### For Digital Products:

- [ ] **Paper prototype** (low): Drawn screens
- [ ] **Clickable wireframe** (medium): Interactive flows
- [ ] **Coded prototype** (high): Functional UI

**Testing: Do users like the design?**
→ High fidelity ✅

**Testing: Is this technically feasible?**
→ High fidelity (functional) ✅

**Testing: Which of 5 ideas is best?**
→ Low fidelity (all 5) ✅

**Testing: Are these interactions intuitive?**

## Final Decision

**Selected Fidelity**: ________________

**Rationale** (why this level is appropriate):
- Objective: _______________________
- Time available: __________________
- Stage: __________________________
- Number of concepts: ______________

**Build plan**:
- Start date: _____________________
- Target completion: ______________
- Tools: _________________________
- Builder(s): _____________________

**Remember**: When in doubt, start lower fidelity. You can always increase fidelity if testing reveals you need more detail. It's harder to go backwards.
