# Design Thinking Facilitator Expansion Pack

## Overview

The Design Thinking Facilitator is a comprehensive BMAD-powered expansion pack that guides teams through innovative problem-solving using the Design Thinking methodology. It combines BMAD's agentic planning approach with human-centered design principles to deliver breakthrough solutions.

## What is Design Thinking?

Design Thinking is a non-linear, iterative process that teams use to understand users, challenge assumptions, redefine problems, and create innovative solutions. This expansion pack provides AI-powered facilitation through all five phases:

1. **Empathize** - Understand the user
2. **Define** - Frame the problem
3. **Ideate** - Generate creative solutions
4. **Prototype** - Build tangible solutions
5. **Test** - Learn from feedback

## Installation & Usage

### For IDE Users (Cursor, VS Code, etc.)

1. Copy the entire `design-thinking-facilitator` directory to your project
2. Load the appropriate agent by referencing the agent file:
   ```
   @design-thinking-facilitator/agents/dt-master.md
   ```

### For Web UI Users (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini)

Use the bundled version from the `dist` folder or reference individual components as needed.

### Quick Start

1. **Start with the DT Master**: Load the `dt-master.md` agent
2. **Choose a workflow**: Select based on your problem type
3. **Follow the phases**: The agent will guide you through each Design Thinking phase
4. **Use templates**: Leverage pre-built templates for each activity
5. **Check quality**: Use checklists to ensure thoroughness

## Workflow Examples

### Innovation Sprint (5 Days)
```
Day 1: Empathize & Define
Day 2: Define & Ideate
Day 3: Ideate & Prototype
Day 4: Prototype & Test
Day 5: Test & Iterate
```

### Product Development Cycle
```
1. Market Research & User Discovery
2. Problem Definition & Opportunity Mapping
3. Concept Generation & Evaluation
4. Rapid Prototyping & MVP Development
5. User Testing & Product Iteration
```

## Integration with BMAD Method

This expansion pack leverages BMAD's core principles:

- **Agentic Planning**: Specialized agents collaborate to create comprehensive design solutions
- **Context-Engineered Development**: Each phase builds upon previous insights with full context preservation
- **Human-in-the-Loop**: Continuous refinement through user feedback and iteration
- **Domain Expertise**: Deep integration of Design Thinking best practices

## Best Practices

1. **Start with Empathy**: Always begin by understanding your users
2. **Defer Judgment**: Keep ideation phases open and non-critical
3. **Bias Toward Action**: Build quick prototypes to test assumptions
4. **Embrace Failure**: Learn from what doesn't work
5. **Iterate Continuously**: Design Thinking is cyclical, not linear
