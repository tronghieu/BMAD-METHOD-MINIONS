# Task: Conduct User Research

**Design Thinking Phase**: Empathize
**Duration**: 1-4 weeks (flexible based on scope)
**Agent**: Empathy Researcher
**Difficulty**: Medium-High

## Purpose

Build deep understanding of users' needs, behaviors, pain points, and motivations through direct observation and engagement. This foundational research informs all subsequent Design Thinking phases and ensures solutions are truly human-centered.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this task, ensure you have:

- [ ] **Research objectives defined** (What do we need to learn?)
- [ ] **Target users identified** (Who are we designing for?)
- [ ] **Stakeholder buy-in** (Time and budget approved)
- [ ] **Ethics/privacy considerations** (Consent forms, data protection)
- [ ] **Research methods selected** (Interviews, observations, etc.)
- [ ] **Team assembled** (Researchers, note-takers if needed)
- [ ] **Tools prepared** (Recording equipment, templates, incentives)

## Step-by-Step Process

### Phase 1: Research Planning (1-3 days)

#### 1.1 Define Research Questions

Start with broad questions you need answered:
- What problems do users currently face in [domain]?
- How do users currently solve [problem]?
- What are users' goals when doing [activity]?
- What frustrates users most about [current solution]?
- What do users value/prioritize in [domain]?

**Output**: 5-10 focused research questions

#### 1.2 Select Research Methods

Choose 2-3 complementary methods:

**Primary Methods**:
- **User Interviews** (depth, motivations) - Most common
- **Contextual Observation** (actual behavior in context)
- **Shadowing** (follow user through full journey)
- **Diary Studies** (experiences over time)

**Secondary Methods**:
- **Surveys** (quantitative patterns)
- **Focus Groups** (group dynamics, brainstorming)
- **Analytics Review** (behavioral data)
- **Expert Interviews** (domain knowledge)

**Typical combination**:
- 8-12 in-depth user interviews
- 3-5 contextual observations
- Survey to 100+ users (optional)

#### 1.3 Recruit Participants

**Sample Size Guidelines**:
- Interviews: 8-12 users (diminishing returns after)
- Observations: 5-8 sessions
- Surveys: 100+ for statistical relevance

**Recruitment Strategies**:
- Existing customer list (email outreach)
- Social media targeted ads
- User research platforms (UserTesting, Respondent.io)
- Guerrilla recruitment (public spaces)
- Referrals from participants
- Professional recruiters

**Screening Criteria**:
- Must be actual users or target audience
- Diverse demographics (age, background, skill level)
- Range of experience (novices to experts)
- Include edge cases (power users, strugglers)

**Incentives**:
- $50-150 per hour (varies by audience)
- Gift cards to popular retailers
- Free product/service access
- Contribution to charity

#### 1.4 Prepare Research Materials

**Interview Guide**:
- Opening/rapport building (5 min)
- Background questions (10 min)
- Core experience questions (30 min)
- Closing/future questions (5 min)
- Thank you/next steps (5 min)

**Consent Forms**:
- Purpose of research
- How data will be used
- Recording permissions
- Anonymity assurances
- Right to withdraw

**Recording Setup**:
- Audio/video recorder (with backup)
- Note-taking templates
- Observer guidelines
- Photo/screenshot permissions

### Phase 2: Conduct Interviews (1-2 weeks)

#### 2.1 Interview Best Practices

**Opening (5 minutes)**:
- Build rapport: "Tell me about yourself..."
- Set expectations: "This is about learning from you"
- Explain confidentiality
- Get recording permission
- Make them comfortable

**During Interview (40-50 minutes)**:

**Ask open-ended questions**:
- ✅ "Walk me through the last time you..."
- ✅ "What's frustrating about..."
- ✅ "How do you currently..."
- ❌ "Do you like...?" (Yes/no question)
- ❌ "Wouldn't it be better if..." (Leading question)

**Follow the "Five Whys"**:
- User: "I don't use feature X"
- You: "Why not?"
- User: "It's complicated"
- You: "What makes it complicated?"
- User: "Too many steps"
- You: "Why are those steps problematic?"
- [Continue drilling down to root cause]

**Look for**:
- **Workarounds**: "I use a spreadsheet instead..." (pain point!)
- **Emotional language**: "I hate when..." "I love..."
- **Stories**: Concrete examples reveal truth
- **Contradictions**: What they say vs do
- **Hesitations**: Pauses indicate complexity

**Techniques**:
- **Silent pauses**: Count to 5 before asking next question
- **"Tell me more..."**: Gets depth on any answer
- **Show me**: Ask for demonstration
- **Contrast questions**: "How is this different from...?"
- **Hypothetical scenarios**: "If you could wave a magic wand..."

**Avoid**:
- Talking too much (80/20 rule - they talk 80%)
- Explaining your product/idea
- Defending current solutions
- Leading questions
- Multi-part questions

#### 2.2 Contextual Observation

When observing users in their environment:

**Setup**:
- Get permission to observe
- Minimize interference
- Explain think-aloud protocol
- Position for good view
- Start recording

**Observe**:
- Actual behaviors (not what they say they do)
- Physical environment
- Tools and artifacts used
- Interactions with others
- Frustration points (sighs, errors, workarounds)
- Delight moments (smiles, efficiency)

**Ask clarifying questions**:
- "Why did you do it that way?"
- "What just happened there?"
- "What are you thinking right now?"

**Document**:
- Photos of workspace/context
- Screenshots of tools used
- Workflow diagrams
- Direct quotes
- Behavioral patterns

#### 2.3 Real-Time Documentation

**During Session**:
- Verbatim quotes (use quotation marks)
- Observations (mark with [OBS])
- Emotions (mark with [EMO])
- Body language notes
- Timestamp key moments

**Note Template**:
```
Participant: P7 (Sarah, age 34, freq user)
Date: [date]
Method: Interview
Duration: 52 min

[00:05] "I try to use it every day but usually give up"
[00:12] [OBS] Showed frustration when describing login
[00:18] [EMO] Lit up when talking about feature X
[00:23] "My workaround is to just email it to myself"

Key insights:
- Authentication is major friction point
- Feature X is high value
- Email remains default tool

Questions for follow-up:
- Why does login fail?
- What makes feature X valuable?
```

#### 2.4 Post-Session Debrief

Immediately after each session (within 1 hour):

- Review notes, fill gaps
- Highlight surprising insights
- Note quotes to use later
- Rate session quality (1-5)
- Update recruitment if needed
- Schedule any follow-ups

### Phase 3: Synthesize Research (3-5 days)

#### 3.1 Organize Raw Data

Create research repository:
```
/research
  /interviews
    /participant-01.md
    /participant-02.md
    ...
  /observations
    /session-01.md
    ...
  /photos
  /recordings (with timestamps)
  /synthesis
```

#### 3.2 Affinity Mapping

**Process**:
1. Print all quotes/observations on sticky notes (one insight per note)
2. Spread on large wall
3. Silently group similar insights
4. Discuss groupings with team
5. Name each cluster
6. Identify patterns across clusters

**Typical Clusters**:
- Pain points
- Workarounds
- Goals & motivations
- Context & environment
- Tools currently used
- Emotional responses

#### 3.3 Create Empathy Maps

For each key user segment, map:

**Says**: Direct quotes
- "I need it to be faster"
- "I don't trust it"
- "This is confusing"

**Thinks**: Inferred thoughts
- Worried about making mistakes
- Desires simplicity
- Values efficiency

**Does**: Observed behaviors
- Uses workarounds
- Skips certain features
- Relies on help from others

**Feels**: Emotions
- Frustrated during setup
- Delighted by quick wins
- Anxious about errors

**Output**: 1-2 page empathy map visual

#### 3.4 Identify Insights

Transform observations into insights:

**Observation**: "8 out of 10 users email files to themselves"
**Insight**: "Users don't trust cloud storage or find it too complex; email is their universal tool"

**Observation**: "Users describe feature X as 'powerful but scary'"
**Insight**: "Power features need better scaffolding to reduce intimidation"

**Criteria for good insights**:
- ✅ Reveal underlying need, not just surface problem
- ✅ Suggest opportunity space
- ✅ Based on patterns (3+ users)
- ✅ Surprising or counter-intuitive
- ✅ Actionable for design

**Output**: 10-20 key insights

#### 3.5 Develop Personas

Create 2-4 representative user personas:

**Persona Structure**:
- **Name & Photo**: Make them feel real
- **Demographics**: Age, role, context
- **Quote**: Captures their perspective
- **Goals**: What they want to achieve
- **Frustrations**: Current pain points
- **Behaviors**: How they currently work
- **Needs**: What would help them

**Example**:
```
SARAH THE STRUGGLER
"I know there's a better way, but I don't have time to figure it out"

Demographics: 34, Marketing Manager, 2 years in role
Goals: Create reports quickly, impress leadership
Frustrations: Tools are complex, no time for training
Behaviors: Uses Excel for everything, googles problems
Needs: Simple onboarding, templates, quick wins
```

**Use personas to**:
- Validate design decisions ("Would Sarah understand this?")
- Prioritize features ("What does Sarah need most?")
- Build empathy in team

#### 3.6 Map User Journeys

Document current-state journey:

**Journey Stages**:
1. Awareness
2. Consideration
3. Purchase/Signup
4. Onboarding
5. Regular Use
6. Problem-Solving
7. Renewal/Churn

**For Each Stage Document**:
- Actions (what user does)
- Thoughts (what they're thinking)
- Emotions (how they feel) - plot on emotion curve
- Pain points (where they struggle)
- Opportunities (where we can help)

**Output**: Visual journey map showing emotional highs and lows

### Phase 4: Share Findings (1-2 days)

#### 4.1 Create Research Report

**Executive Summary** (1 page):
- Research objectives
- Methods used
- Participant overview
- Top 5 insights
- Recommended focus areas

**Detailed Findings** (5-10 pages):
- Key insights with supporting quotes
- Empathy maps
- Personas
- Journey maps
- Opportunities identified

**Appendix**:
- Full interview notes
- Photos/screenshots
- Methodology details

#### 4.2 Present to Stakeholders

**Research Readout Session** (60-90 min):

**Structure**:
1. **Context** (5 min): What we researched and why
2. **Method** (5 min): How we conducted research
3. **Participants** (5 min): Who we talked to
4. **Insights** (30 min): Key findings with video clips/quotes
5. **Personas** (10 min): Introduce user archetypes
6. **Opportunities** (15 min): What this means for design
7. **Q&A** (15 min): Discussion

**Tips**:
- Show, don't tell (use video clips, photos)
- Lead with stories (specific user examples)
- Make findings visceral (create empathy)
- Connect to business goals
- End with clear opportunity areas

7. **Insight List**: 10-20 key findings
8. **Research Report**: Documented findings
9. **Presentation**: Stakeholder readout deck

## Common Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge: "Users give surface-level answers"

**Solutions**:
- Ask for specific stories: "Tell me about the last time..."
- Use "5 Whys" to drill down
- Request demonstrations: "Show me how you..."
- Observe actual behavior vs stated behavior
- Build more rapport before diving deep

### Challenge: "Participants want to design solutions"

**Solutions**:
- Redirect: "That's interesting - what problem does that solve?"
- Focus on current experience: "How do you handle this today?"
- Acknowledge then pivot: "Good idea - but first, tell me why that matters?"
- Ask about problems, not solutions

### Challenge: "Conflicting feedback from different users"

**Solutions**:
- Look for segments (maybe different user types)
- Find patterns within groups
- Weight by frequency and intensity
- Design for primary persona, accommodate others
- Multiple solutions for different needs

### Challenge: "Too much data, can't synthesize"

**Solutions**:
- Do synthesis incrementally (after each 3-4 interviews)
- Focus on patterns (3+ users mentioning)
- Use affinity mapping to find clusters
- Timebox synthesis sessions
- Involve full team in synthesis

### Challenge: "Stakeholders dismiss findings"

**Solutions**:
- Use video clips (harder to dismiss real users)
- Connect to business metrics
- Show consensus across multiple users
- Bring stakeholders to observe sessions
- Create compelling personas
- Quantify when possible ("8 of 10 users...")

## Success Indicators

You'll know research was successful when:

✅ **Rich insights**: Surprising, non-obvious findings
✅ **Pattern clarity**: Clear themes across users
✅ **Team alignment**: Shared understanding of users
✅ **Compelling personas**: Team references them naturally
✅ **Opportunity clarity**: Clear areas to focus design
✅ **Stakeholder buy-in**: Leadership supports direction
✅ **Actionable**: Insights suggest specific design directions

## Research Ethics

Always follow ethical guidelines:
- **Informed consent**: Explain purpose, get permission
- **Anonymity**: Protect participant identities
- **Data security**: Store recordings/notes securely
- **Compensation**: Fair payment for time
- **Right to withdraw**: Participants can stop anytime
- **No harm**: Don't distress participants
- **Honest representation**: Report findings accurately

## Tips by Method

### For Interviews:
- Test questions with colleague first
- Have backup recorder
- Take notes even if recording
- Make eye contact, don't just read script
- Be comfortable with silence

### For Observations:
- Be a fly on wall (don't interfere)
- Look for workarounds (gold mine for pain points)
- Note environment/context
- Ask "why" about behaviors
- Photo/video with permission

### For Remote Research:
- Send tech setup instructions in advance
- Test tools before session
- Have screen share ready
- Record video if possible
- Build rapport extra carefully (harder remotely)
