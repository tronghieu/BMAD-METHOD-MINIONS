# Task: Run Brainstorm Session

**Design Thinking Phase**: Ideate
**Duration**: 45-90 minutes
**Agent**: Ideation Coach
**Difficulty**: Medium

## Purpose

Facilitate a structured brainstorming session that generates a high volume of diverse ideas through divergent thinking and creative techniques.

## Prerequisites

- [ ] HMW question or problem statement defined
- [ ] Participants recruited (4-8 people ideal)
- [ ] Time blocked (minimum 45 minutes uninterrupted)
- [ ] Space prepared (physical or virtual)
- [ ] Materials ready (sticky notes, markers, whiteboard)
- [ ] Brainstorming technique selected
- [ ] Creative warmup chosen

## Step-by-Step Process

### Phase 1: Setup & Energize (10-15 minutes)

#### Welcome & Frame (3 minutes)

"Welcome! For the next [X] minutes, we're going to generate solutions to [problem]. Today's session rules:
- **Defer judgment** - no critiquing ideas during generation
- **Go for quantity** - aim for 50+ ideas minimum
- **Encourage wild ideas** - unusual sparks innovation
- **Build on others** - 'Yes, and...' thinking
- **Be visual** - sketches welcome, no artistic skill needed"

#### Context Refresher (2 minutes)
- Briefly recap empathy insights
- Display the HMW question prominently
- Share success criteria

#### Creative Warmup (5-10 minutes)

**Select Based on Team Energy**:
- **High energy**: 30 Circles or Crazy 8s
- **Low energy**: Squiggle Birds or Mashup Machine
- **Stuck/serious**: Design the Worst or Worst Possible Idea
- **New/nervous**: Alternative Uses or Word Association

See `data/ideation-warmups.md` for full warmup library

### Phase 2: Divergent Ideation (30-60 minutes)

#### Technique Selection

**Choose from** `data/brainstorming-techniques.md`:

**Quick sessions (30-45 min)**:
- Classic Brainstorming
- What If Scenarios
- Worst Possible Idea (then flip)
- Crazy 8s

**Medium sessions (45-90 min)**:
- SCAMPER Method
- Mind Mapping
- Role Playing

#### Classic Brainstorming Execution

**Individual + Share Method**:
1. **Silent generation** (5-10 minutes)
   - Each person generates ideas independently
   - One idea per sticky note
   - No filtering or judging

2. **Share round-robin** (15-20 minutes)
   - Each person shares one idea
   - Post on board
   - No discussion yet, just capture
   - Continue rounds until all ideas shared

3. **Build and expand** (10-15 minutes)
   - Team builds on posted ideas
   - "Yes, and..." thinking
   - Combine ideas
   - Create variations

**Group Collaborative Method**:
1. **Rapid-fire calling** (20-30 minutes)
   - Start with problem restatement
   - Anyone calls out ideas
   - Scribe captures all verbatim
   - No evaluation or discussion
   - Build on previous ideas

2. **Encourage wild ideas**
   - Celebrate unusual suggestions
   - "What if we..." provocations
   - Remove constraints temporarily

#### Apply Creative Constraints (Optional)

Add 1-2 constraints from `data/creative-constraints-guide.md`:

**Examples**:
- **Budget**: "$10 solution" or "Zero cost"
- **Time**: "Implemented tomorrow" or "5-minute solution"
- **User**: "For 5-year-olds" or "One-handed use only"
- **Tech**: "No internet" or "Works on any device"

**Announce**: "Additional challenge: [constraint]. How does this change our thinking?"

#### Mid-Session Energy Check (at 20-min mark)

**If energy drops**:
- Quick 2-minute stand-up stretch
- Switch to different technique
- Add surprise constraint
- Do 60-second speed round

**If ideas plateau**:
- "What would [competitor/Disney/nature] do?"
- "How would we make this worse?" then reverse
- Add provocative "What if?" scenario
- Random word stimulation

#### Push for Quantity

**Set targets and track**:
- "We have 28 ideas—let's get to 50!"
- "Last 5 minutes—sprint finish!"
- Celebrate milestones: "40 ideas! Keep going!"

**Remember**: Quantity triggers quality - don't stop early

### Phase 3: Wrap-Up & Documentation (5 minutes)

#### Capture Everything

- Photo the wall/board
- Collect all sticky notes
- Export digital board
- Number all ideas (for reference)

#### Quick Pulse Check

"How did that feel?"
"What surprised you?"
"Notice any patterns?"

**Don't evaluate yet** - save for next session

## Expected Outputs

1. **Idea Collection**: 50-100+ raw ideas documented
2. **Session Photos**: Wall/board documentation
3. **Energy Notes**: What worked, what didn't
4. **Quantity Achieved**: Final count
5. **Idea Archive**: Digital or physical storage

## Brainstorming Techniques Library

### 1. Classic Brainstorming
Free-flow idea generation with deferred judgment

### 2. Brainwriting (Silent Brainstorming)
Individual writing, then pass and build

### 3. Crazy 8s
8 sketches in 8 minutes (1 minute each)

### 4. SCAMPER
Systematic prompts: Substitute, Combine, Adapt, Modify, Put to other use, Eliminate, Reverse

### 5. Worst Possible Idea
Generate terrible solutions, then reverse them

### 6. Mind Mapping
Visual branching from central concept

### 7. Role Playing
"How would [persona/competitor] solve this?"

### 8. What If Scenarios
Provocative "What if..." questions

See `data/brainstorming-techniques.md` for all 23 techniques

## Common Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge: "Only generated 15 ideas"

**Solutions**:
- Set quantity mandate: "Not leaving until we hit 50"
- Switch techniques mid-session
- Add random constraint
- Do "worst ideas" round then reverse
- Break into smaller teams competing

### Challenge: "Everyone's being too safe/realistic"

**Solutions**:
- Do "Worst Possible Idea" warmup
- Add extreme constraint: "For astronauts on Mars"
- "Yes, and..." enforcement
- Celebrate the craziest idea explicitly
- Remove feasibility from generation

### Challenge: "One person dominating"

**Solutions**:
- Switch to silent brainstorming (brainwriting)
- Use round-robin (each person one idea, repeat)
- Anonymous sticky note submission
- "Next idea must come from someone who hasn't shared"
- Breakout into pairs

### Challenge: "We're stuck/circling same ideas"

**Solutions**:
- Force new technique: "Next 10 minutes, SCAMPER only"
- Random stimulation: Pick random word, connect to problem
- Role reversal: "How would competitor solve this?"
- Change context: "What if this was a physical product?"
- Take 5-minute break, then sprint finish

## Success Indicators

✅ **Quantity achieved**: 50+ ideas generated
✅ **Energy present**: Laughter, excitement, building on ideas
✅ **Diversity of ideas**: Multiple approaches, not all similar
✅ **Wild ideas emerged**: At least 5-10 "crazy" concepts
✅ **Participation balanced**: Everyone contributed
✅ **Momentum**: Ready to continue refining ideas

## Tips for Virtual Sessions

- Pre-work: Share problem day before
- Breakout rooms for parallel ideation
- Ensure everyone comfortable with digital tools
- Shorter activities with more check-ins
- Async option: Pre-generate ideas, sync for building
- Use sketches, icons, colors heavily
- More breaks, music, movement prompts
