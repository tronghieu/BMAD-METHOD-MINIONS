# Task: Generate HMW Questions

**Design Thinking Phase**: Define
**Duration**: 30-60 minutes
**Agent**: Problem Definer
**Difficulty**: Low-Medium

## Purpose

Transform problem statements into "How Might We" (HMW) questions that reframe challenges as opportunities and inspire creative ideation.

## Prerequisites

- [ ] Problem statement(s) crafted
- [ ] Supporting research available
- [ ] Team assembled (3-8 people ideal)
- [ ] Whiteboard or digital collaboration tool ready

## What is an HMW Question?

**"How Might We"** is an optimistic, actionable question format that:
- **"How"** suggests solutions exist
- **"Might"** acknowledges multiple possibilities
- **"We"** implies collaboration and ownership

**Purpose**:
- Bridge problem definition and ideation
- Inspire creative solutions
- Provide focus without prescribing answers
- Enable divergent thinking

## HMW Question Structure

### Basic Formula

```
How might we [achieve need] for [user] in [context]?
```

### From POV to HMW

**POV Statement**:
"Busy professionals need quick file sharing because they work across devices and lack time for complex tools"

**HMW Questions**:
- How might we enable instant file access across devices without setup?
- How might we make file sharing as simple as texting?
- How might we eliminate the need to learn a new tool?
- How might we leverage tools professionals already use?

## Step-by-Step Process

### Phase 1: Generate HMW Variations (20-30 minutes)

#### Technique 1: Amplify the Good

Focus on making positive aspects even better

**From POV**:
"Users love feature X but rarely discover it"

**HMWs**:
- How might we make feature X impossible to miss?
- How might we create more moments like feature X?
- How might we help users discover power features faster?

#### Technique 2: Remove the Bad

Eliminate pain points and obstacles

**From POV**:
"Setup process causes 40% abandonment"

**HMWs**:
- How might we eliminate setup entirely?
- How might we make setup feel instant?
- How might we reduce setup to under 30 seconds?

#### Technique 3: Explore Opposites

Flip the problem to see new angles

**From POV**:
"Complex features intimidate novice users"

**HMWs**:
- How might we make complexity feel simple?
- How might we turn novices into experts quickly?
- How might we make learning feel like playing?

#### Technique 4: Question Assumptions

Challenge what seems fixed

**From POV**:
"Users need training to use our product"

**HMWs**:
- How might we create a product that needs no training?
- How might we make the product teach itself?
- How might we learn from user behavior instead of training?

#### Technique 5: Go Analogical

Draw inspiration from other domains

**From POV**:
"File sharing requires multiple steps"

**HMWs**:
- How might we make file sharing as easy as texting?
- How might we share like nature shares (wind spreading seeds)?
- How might we apply grocery delivery speed to files?

#### Technique 6: Change a Status Quo

Reimagine what's "normal"

**From POV**:
"Users must remember passwords"

**HMWs**:
- How might we eliminate passwords entirely?
- How might we authenticate without user action?
- How might we make security invisible?

#### Technique 7: Break the Problem into Pieces

Address sub-components

**From POV**:
"Onboarding is overwhelming"

**HMWs**:
- How might we make the first step effortless?
- How might we show value before asking for effort?
- How might we personalize onboarding by role?
- How might we let users skip and explore?

### Phase 2: Rapid Generation (10-15 minutes)

**Individual Brainstorm** (5 min):
- Set timer
- Each person generates 5-10 HMWs
- One per sticky note
- No filtering, all ideas welcome

**Round-Robin Sharing** (5-10 min):
- Each person shares one HMW
- Post on board
- No discussion/critique yet
- Go multiple rounds until all shared

**Target**: 20-40 HMW questions generated

### Phase 3: Refine HMWs (15-20 minutes)

#### Check for Good HMWs

**Too Broad?**
- ❌ "How might we make everything better?"
- ✅ "How might we reduce setup time to under 60 seconds?"

**Too Narrow?**
- ❌ "How might we change the button color to blue?"
- ✅ "How might we make the primary action obvious?"

**Just Right?**
- ✅ Specific enough to be actionable
- ✅ Broad enough for multiple solutions
- ✅ Inspiring and energizing
- ✅ Based on research insights

#### Cluster Related HMWs

**Group by theme**:
```
THEME: Speed & Efficiency
- HMW reduce setup to 30 seconds?
- HMW eliminate unnecessary steps?
- HMW automate configuration?

THEME: Simplicity
- HMW make features self-explanatory?
- HMW reduce cognitive load?
- HMW guide without overwhelming?

THEME: Trust & Confidence
- HMW build credibility quickly?
- HMW make security visible?
- HMW provide social proof?
```

### Phase 4: Select HMWs for Ideation (10-15 minutes)

#### Selection Criteria

**Actionability**: Can we ideate on this?
**Impact**: Would solving this make big difference?
**Feasibility**: Is this achievable?
**Excitement**: Does this inspire the team?
**Coverage**: Do we address key problem areas?

#### Selection Methods

**Method 1: Dot Voting**
- Each person gets 3 votes
- Can stack on favorites
- Top 3-5 HMWs selected

**Method 2: Discussion + Consensus**
- Review each cluster
- Debate merits
- Choose by agreement

**Method 3: Multi-Round Voting**
- Round 1: Narrow 40 → 15
- Round 2: Narrow 15 → 7
- Round 3: Select final 3-5

**Output**: 3-5 HMW questions for ideation

## HMW Question Variations

### Scoping Variations

**Broad Scope** (for exploration):
"How might we reimagine online shopping?"

**Medium Scope** (for focused innovation):
"How might we help shoppers feel confident in size selection?"

**Narrow Scope** (for tactical improvements):
"How might we reduce returns due to sizing issues?"

### User Variations

Create HMWs for different users:
- "HMW help novices... ?"
- "HMW enable experts to... ?"
- "HMW support mobile users... ?"

### Journey Variations

Frame HMWs by journey stage:
- Awareness: "HMW help people discover... ?"
- Onboarding: "HMW make first use effortless... ?"
- Retention: "HMW create lasting habits... ?"

## Expected Outputs

1. **HMW Collection**: 20-40 generated questions
2. **Clustered Themes**: Organized by topic/focus area
3. **Selected HMWs**: 3-5 for ideation phase
4. **Selection Rationale**: Why these were chosen
5. **HMW Brief**: Documentation for ideation team

## Common Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge: "All HMWs sound the same"

**Solutions**:
- Use different reframing techniques
- Break problem into sub-parts
- Consider different user segments
- Add creative constraints (HMW... using only mobile? ...in 10 seconds?)

### Challenge: "HMWs are too generic"

**Solutions**:
- Add specific context: "...for [specific user] when [specific situation]"
- Include constraints: "...without requiring [X]"
- Reference research: "...so that [insight from research]"

### Challenge: "Can't choose which HMWs to pursue"

**Solutions**:
- Pick different types (quick win + big innovation)
- Test multiple in parallel during ideation
- Start with highest-impact, iterate to others
- Let ideation quality decide (prototype multiple)

## Success Indicators

✅ **Quantity**: 20+ HMWs generated
✅ **Diversity**: Multiple approaches and angles
✅ **Specificity**: Clear focus, not vague
✅ **Inspiration**: Team excited about possibilities
✅ **Selection**: Clear top 3-5 identified
✅ **Readiness**: Can immediately begin ideation
