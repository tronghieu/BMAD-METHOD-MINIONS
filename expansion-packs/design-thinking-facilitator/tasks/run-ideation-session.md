# Task: Run Ideation Session

**Design Thinking Phase**: Ideate
**Duration**: 60-180 minutes
**Agent**: Ideation Coach
**Difficulty**: Medium

## Purpose

Facilitate a structured brainstorming session that generates a high volume of diverse, innovative solutions to a well-defined problem. This task bridges the Define and Prototype phases by transforming insights and HMW questions into actionable concepts.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this task, ensure you have:

- [ ] **Clear problem statement** or HMW question from Define phase
- [ ] **Participants recruited** (4-8 people ideal, diverse perspectives)
- [ ] **Time blocked** (minimum 60 minutes uninterrupted)
- [ ] **Space prepared** (physical or virtual collaboration space)
- [ ] **Materials ready** (sticky notes, markers, whiteboard, or digital tools)
- [ ] **Context shared** (participants briefed on problem and empathy insights)
- [ ] **Technique selected** (from brainstorming-techniques.md based on context)
- [ ] **Warmup chosen** (from ideation-warmups.md to prime creativity)

## Step-by-Step Process

### Phase 1: Setup & Energize (10-15 minutes)

#### 1.1 Physical/Virtual Setup
**Physical Space**:
- Arrange chairs in circle or U-shape (no barriers)
- Clear wall space for idea posting
- Display HMW question prominently
- Materials within reach
- Natural light if possible

**Virtual Space**:
- Set up digital whiteboard (Miro/Mural/FigJam)
- Test screen sharing and breakout rooms
- Create idea collection template
- Ensure everyone has edit access

#### 1.2 Welcome & Frame (3 minutes)
"Welcome! For the next [X] minutes, we're going to generate solutions to [problem]. Today's session rules:
- **Defer judgment** - no critiquing ideas during generation
- **Go for quantity** - aim for 50+ ideas minimum
- **Encourage wild ideas** - unusual sparks innovation
- **Build on others** - 'Yes, and...' thinking
- **Be visual** - sketches welcome, no artistic skill needed"

#### 1.3 Context Refresher (2 minutes)
- Briefly recap empathy insights (1-2 key findings)
- Display the HMW question
- Share success criteria: "We'll know this worked if..."

#### 1.4 Creative Warmup (5-10 minutes)
Select from `ideation-warmups.md` based on team energy:
- **High energy team**: 30 Circles or Crazy 8s
- **Low energy/Monday morning**: Squiggle Birds or Mashup Machine
- **Stuck/serious team**: Design the Worst or Worst Possible Idea
- **New/nervous team**: Alternative Uses or Word Association

**Run the warmup** - strict time limits, celebrate all outputs

### Phase 2: Divergent Ideation (30-60 minutes)

#### 2.1 Technique Selection

Choose primary technique from `brainstorming-techniques.md`:

**Quick sessions (30-45 min)**:
- Classic Brainstorming (#1)
- What If Scenarios (#2)
- Worst Possible Idea (#5)
- Crazy 8s (#12)

**Medium sessions (45-90 min)**:
- SCAMPER Method (#7)
- Mind Mapping (#9)
- Role Playing (#19)

**Deep sessions (90+ min)**:
- Six Thinking Hats (#8)
- Morphological Analysis (#15)
- Combine multiple techniques

#### 2.2 Apply Creative Constraints (Optional)

Add 1-2 constraints from `creative-constraints-guide.md` to focus thinking:
- Budget: "$10 solution" or "Zero cost"
- Time: "Implemented tomorrow" or "5-minute solution"
- User: "For 5-year-olds" or "One-handed use only"
- Tech: "No internet" or "Works on any device"

Announce constraint: "Additional challenge: [constraint]. How does this change our thinking?"

#### 2.3 Idea Generation Execution

**For Individual + Share Techniques**:
1. Set timer (5-15 minutes)
2. Silent generation phase
3. Each person generates ideas independently
4. Share round-robin or post simultaneously
5. No discussion yet, just capture

**For Group Collaborative Techniques**:
1. Start with problem restatement
2. Rapid-fire idea calling
3. Scribe captures all ideas verbatim
4. Build on previous ideas
5. Encourage "Yes, and..."

**For Visual/Sketch Techniques**:
1. Distribute paper/digital canvas
2. Set strict time per sketch
3. Call time loudly ("30 seconds left!")
4. Share gallery-walk style
5. Vote with dots/emojis

#### 2.4 Mid-Session Energy Check (at 20-min mark)

**If energy drops**:
- Quick 2-minute stand-up stretch
- Switch to different technique
- Add surprise constraint
- Do 60-second speed round

**If ideas plateau**:
- "What would [competitor/Disney/nature] do?"
- "How would we make this worse?" then reverse
- Add provocative "What if?" scenario
- Random word stimulation

#### 2.5 Push for Quantity

Set targets and track progress:
- "We have 28 ideas—let's get to 50!"
- "Last 5 minutes—sprint finish!"
- Celebrate milestones: "40 ideas! Keep going!"

**Quantity triggers quality** - don't stop early

### Phase 3: Clustering & Convergence (20-40 minutes)

#### 3.1 Idea Organization (10-15 minutes)

**Affinity Mapping**:
1. Display all ideas visibly (wall or digital board)
2. Read through together briefly
3. Silent sorting: group similar concepts
4. Discuss groupings
5. Name each cluster (themes)
6. Identify patterns

**Typical clusters might be**:
- Technology solutions
- Process improvements
- Behavior change approaches
- Physical product ideas
- Service design concepts

#### 3.2 Initial Filtering (5 minutes)

Quickly remove:
- Duplicates (keep better-articulated version)
- Out-of-scope ideas (park for later)
- Non-starters (violate hard constraints)

Keep everything else!

#### 3.3 Selection Method (10-15 minutes)

Choose evaluation approach:

**Dot Voting** (fastest):
- Each person gets 3-5 votes
- Can stack votes on favorites
- Mark with dots/stars
- Top 5-10 move forward

**Impact/Effort Matrix**:
- Draw 2x2 grid: Impact (Y-axis) vs Effort (X-axis)
- Place ideas on matrix
- Focus on High Impact/Low Effort (quick wins)
- Consider High Impact/High Effort (major projects)

**NUF Test** (most thorough):
Rate each idea 1-5 on:
- **New**: How novel/innovative?
- **Useful**: How valuable to users?
- **Feasible**: How realistic to build?
- Total score → top ideas advance

**Criteria Matrix**:
| Idea | Impact | Feasibility | Speed | Cost | Total |
|------|--------|------------|-------|------|-------|
| A    | 4      | 3          | 5     | 4    | 16    |

#### 3.4 Select Top Concepts (5 minutes)

Choose **3-5 ideas** to develop further:
- Mix of safe and bold
- Different approaches (don't pick 3 similar ideas)
- Representative of different clusters
- Energy from team ("excited to build this")

Document selection rationale: "We chose these because..."

### Phase 4: Concept Development (20-30 minutes)

#### 4.1 Assign Development Teams

- Divide into small groups (2-3 people)
- Each team takes one top concept
- Mix skills and perspectives

#### 4.2 Concept Elaboration (15 minutes)

Each team develops:

**Concept Name**: Catchy, memorable
**One-Sentence Description**: What it is
**Key Features**: 3-5 main capabilities
**User Benefits**: How it helps (not just features)
**Simple Sketch**: Visual representation
**How It Works**: Basic functionality
**Why It's Different**: Unique value

Use template or create concept poster

#### 4.3 Quick Presentations (10 minutes)

Each team presents (2 minutes each):
- Show sketch
- Explain concept
- Highlight why it's exciting
- Answer clarifying questions (no critiques yet)

#### 4.4 Cross-Pollination (5 minutes)

"What if we combined Concept A with Concept B?"
"Could we add feature from Concept C to Concept A?"
Build hybrid concepts if valuable

### Phase 5: Wrap-Up & Next Steps (10-15 minutes)

#### 5.1 Document Everything

Capture:
- All generated ideas (photo wall, export digital board)
- Cluster themes and labels
- Top selected concepts
- Development team notes
- Selection criteria used
- Energy/engagement observations

#### 5.2 Decide Next Actions

Choose path forward:

**Option A: Prototype All Top Concepts**
- Parallel testing of multiple solutions
- Learn from comparison
- Higher resource need

**Option B: Build Single Concept**
- Focus resources
- Faster to prototype
- Choose clear winner

**Option C: Develop Hybrid**
- Combine best elements
- More comprehensive solution
- Requires synthesis time

#### 5.3 Assign Responsibilities

- [ ] Who will lead prototype development?
- [ ] When will prototyping start?
- [ ] What resources are needed?
- [ ] Who needs to approve/review?

#### 5.4 Debrief & Celebrate (5 minutes)

Ask:
- "What surprised you?"
- "What idea excited you most?"
- "What did you notice about our creative process?"

**Celebrate**:
- Thank participants for creativity
- Acknowledge wild ideas
- Recognize quantity achieved
- Build momentum for prototype phase

## Expected Outputs

At the end of this task, you should have:

1. **Idea Bank**: 50-100+ raw ideas documented
2. **Clustered Themes**: Ideas organized into 5-8 categories
3. **Top Concepts**: 3-5 selected ideas for prototyping
4. **Concept Details**: Developed descriptions with sketches
5. **Selection Rationale**: Why these ideas were chosen
6. **Next Steps**: Clear plan for prototyping
7. **Session Documentation**: Photos, notes, digital exports

## Common Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge: "We only generated 15 ideas"

**Solutions**:
- Set quantity mandate: "We're not leaving until we hit 50"
- Switch techniques mid-session
- Add random constraint or provocative question
- Do 10-minute "worst ideas" round then reverse
- Break into smaller teams competing for most ideas

### Challenge: "Everyone's being too safe/realistic"

**Solutions**:
- Do "Worst Possible Idea" warmup
- Add extreme constraint: "For astronauts on Mars"
- "Yes, and..." enforcement - build on wild ideas
- Celebrate the craziest idea explicitly
- Remove feasibility from initial generation

### Challenge: "One person dominating the session"

**Solutions**:
- Switch to silent brainstorming (brainwriting)
- Use round-robin (each person one idea, repeat)
- Anonymous sticky note submission
- "Next idea must come from someone who hasn't shared"
- Breakout into pairs

### Challenge: "We're stuck/circling same ideas"

**Solutions**:
- Force new technique: "Next 10 minutes, SCAMPER only"
- Random stimulation: Pick random word, connect to problem
- Role reversal: "How would competitor solve this?"
- Change context: "What if this was a physical product?"
- Take 5-minute break, then sprint finish

### Challenge: "Too many good ideas, can't choose"

**Solutions**:
- Stack rank top 10, force cuts
- "Which could we prototype fastest?"
- "Which would users value most?"
- Multi-stage voting: narrow 20→10→5→3
- Test multiple concepts (if resources allow)

### Challenge: "Selected ideas too similar"

**Solutions**:
- Force variety: "One safe, one bold, one unexpected"
- "Pick from different clusters"
- "What's the opposite approach?"
- Ensure breadth before depth

## Success Indicators

You'll know the session was successful when:

✅ **Quantity achieved**: 50+ ideas generated
✅ **Energy present**: Laughter, excitement, building on ideas
✅ **Diversity of ideas**: Multiple approaches, not all similar
✅ **Wild ideas emerged**: At least 5-10 "crazy" concepts
✅ **Participation balanced**: Everyone contributed
✅ **Clear next steps**: Team knows what to prototype
✅ **Enthusiasm to continue**: "When can we build this?"

## Tips for Virtual Sessions

- **Pre-work**: Share problem/context day before
- **Breakout rooms**: Use for parallel ideation
- **Digital tools**: Ensure everyone comfortable with interface
- **Engagement**: More check-ins, shorter activities
- **Async option**: Pre-generate ideas, sync for clustering
- **Visual emphasis**: Use sketches, icons, colors heavily
- **Energy harder**: More breaks, music, movement prompts

## Time Variants

**Quick Burst (45-60 min)**:
- 5 min: Setup + warmup
- 25 min: Single technique divergent generation
- 10 min: Quick clustering
- 5 min: Dot voting selection
- 5 min: Next steps

**Standard Session (90-120 min)**:
- Follow full process above

**Deep Dive (3-4 hours)**:
- Multiple divergent techniques (30 min each)
- Deeper concept development
- Prototype planning included
- More rigorous selection process
