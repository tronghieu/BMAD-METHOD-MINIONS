# Task: Plan Prototype Strategy

**Design Thinking Phase**: Prototype
**Duration**: 15-30 minutes
**Agent**: Prototype Builder
**Difficulty**: Low-Medium

## Purpose

Determine the appropriate prototyping approach, fidelity level, and testing objectives to maximize learning while minimizing time and resources.

## Prerequisites

- [ ] Concept selected for prototyping
- [ ] Testing objectives understood
- [ ] Team/builder identified
- [ ] Timeline established

## Key Principle: Build to Learn

**Purpose of prototype**:
- ✅ Test assumptions quickly
- ✅ Get user feedback early
- ✅ Compare solutions
- ❌ Build perfect product
- ❌ Impress stakeholders

## Fidelity Decision Framework

### Low-Fidelity (1-4 hours)
**When**: Early exploration, multiple ideas, limited budget
**Methods**: Paper sketches, storyboards, cardboard models
**Tests**: Core concepts, basic flows

### Medium-Fidelity (4 hours - 2 days)
**When**: Refining interactions, detailed feedback, stakeholder buy-in
**Methods**: Clickable wireframes, digital mockups, video prototypes
**Tests**: Workflows, information architecture

### High-Fidelity (2-5 days)
**When**: Final validation, technical feasibility, handoff
**Methods**: Coded prototypes, no-code apps, working models
**Tests**: Realistic interactions, technical constraints

## Planning Process

### Step 1: Define What to Test (10 min)

**For your concept, identify**:
- **Core assumption**: What must be true for this to work?
- **Riskiest aspect**: What are we most uncertain about?
- **Key interactions**: Critical user flows to show
- **Success criteria**: What feedback indicates success?

### Step 1.5: Map and Prioritize Assumptions (5 min)

**Use the `assumption-mapping-checklist.md`** to systematically brainstorm, categorize, and prioritize all assumptions related to the concept.

- **Output**: A short, prioritized list of the 2-3 most critical, high-uncertainty assumptions that the prototype MUST test.

**Example**:
```
Concept: AI Setup Assistant
Core Assumption: Users will trust AI guidance
Riskiest Aspect: Tone and personality of AI
Key Interactions: Initial greeting, step guidance, error handling
Success: Users complete setup faster and feel confident
```

### Step 2: Choose Fidelity (5 min)

**Decision checklist**:
- How much time available? → Less time = Lower fidelity
- How uncertain are we? → More uncertain = Lower fidelity
- Testing what aspect? → Concept = low, Interaction = medium, Technical = high
- How many concepts? → Multiple = Low fidelity for each

### Step 3: Select Method (5 min)

**Low-Fidelity Options**:
- Paper prototype (interfaces)
- Storyboard (user journey)
- Role-play (service design)
- Physical mockup (products)

**Medium-Fidelity Options**:
- Figma/Sketch wireframes
- PowerPoint/Keynote clickthrough
- Video demonstration

**High-Fidelity Options**:
- Interactive Figma/XD
- HTML/CSS/JS prototype
- No-code tool (Bubble, Webflow)

### Step 4: Assign Resources (5 min)

**Define**:
- Who builds? [Name/role]
- Tools needed? [Software, materials]
- Deadline? [Date/time]
- Review checkpoints? [When]

## Expected Outputs

1. **Fidelity Decision**: Low/Medium/High with rationale
2. **Testing Objectives**: What we need to learn
3. **Method Selection**: Chosen prototyping approach
4. **Resource Plan**: Who, what, when
5. **Success Criteria**: How we'll know it worked
