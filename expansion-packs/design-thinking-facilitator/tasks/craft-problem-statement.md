# Task: Craft Problem Statement

**Design Thinking Phase**: Define
**Duration**: 30-45 minutes
**Agent**: Problem Definer
**Difficulty**: Medium

## Purpose

Create a clear, actionable problem statement that frames the user's challenge in a way that inspires solutions without prescribing them.

## Prerequisites

- [ ] Core user needs identified and prioritized
- [ ] Supporting research evidence available
- [ ] Target user persona(s) defined
- [ ] Team assembled for collaborative framing

## Problem Statement Formats

### Format 1: Point of View (POV) Statement

**Structure**:
```
[User] needs [need] because [insight]
```

**Examples**:
- "Busy professionals need quick file sharing because they work across devices and lack time for complex tools"
- "First-time users need confidence during onboarding because past experiences have made them fearful of breaking things"
- "Remote workers need better work-life boundaries because physical separation no longer exists, leading to burnout"

**Components**:
- **User**: Specific persona or segment (not "everyone")
- **Need**: Verb-based human need (not feature request)
- **Insight**: Compelling reason why (from research)

### Format 2: User-Centered Problem Statement

**Structure**:
```
[User persona] experiences [problem] when [context]
because [root cause], resulting in [negative outcome]
```

**Example**:
"Sarah, a marketing manager, experiences decision paralysis when trying to choose analytics tools because there are too many options without clear differentiation, resulting in delayed campaigns and missed opportunities"

### Format 3: Jobs to Be Done (JTBD)

**Structure**:
```
When [situation], I want to [motivation],
so I can [outcome]
```

**Example**:
"When I'm planning a business trip, I want to quickly understand all my travel options, so I can make confident decisions without spending hours researching"

## Step-by-Step Process

### Phase 1: Select Focus Area (5-10 minutes)

**Choose one priority need** to frame:
- Review prioritized needs from synthesis
- Select the most critical/impactful
- Confirm with team

**Decision factors**:
- Highest user impact
- Most frequent pain point
- Best business alignment
- Feasibility to address

### Phase 2: Draft Problem Statement (15-20 minutes)

#### Method: Collaborative Drafting

**Individual drafting** (5 min):
- Each person writes 1-2 problem statements
- Use different formats (POV, JTBD, etc.)
- Ground in research evidence

**Share and discuss** (10 min):
- Read all drafts aloud
- Discuss strengths of each
- Note compelling phrases
- Identify gaps

**Synthesize** (5 min):
- Combine best elements
- Refine language
- Ensure all components present

### Phase 3: Validate Problem Statement (10-15 minutes)

#### Quality Checklist

**Is it user-centered?**
- [ ] Focuses on user need, not business goal
- [ ] Specific persona/segment identified
- [ ] Describes user's perspective

**Is it actionable?**
- [ ] Broad enough for multiple solutions
- [ ] Narrow enough to provide direction
- [ ] Doesn't prescribe the solution
- [ ] Can immediately start ideating

**Is it evidence-based?**
- [ ] Grounded in research findings
- [ ] Supported by user quotes
- [ ] Observed behaviors, not assumptions
- [ ] Represents pattern (3+ users)

**Is it clear?**
- [ ] Anyone can understand it
- [ ] Specific and concrete (not vague)
- [ ] Single problem focus (not multiple)
- [ ] Compelling and motivating

#### Warning Signs - Revise if:

❌ **Too broad**: "Users need better productivity"
✅ **Better**: "Remote workers need structured breaks because back-to-back video calls cause burnout"

❌ **Includes solution**: "We need to build a mobile app"
✅ **Better**: "Users need on-the-go access because they work from multiple locations"

❌ **Business-focused**: "We need to increase retention"
✅ **Better**: "Users abandon after signup because onboarding doesn't show immediate value"

❌ **Vague**: "Users want things to be easier"
✅ **Better**: "Non-technical users need guided workflows because current tools assume expert knowledge"

### Phase 4: Test with Scenarios (5-10 minutes)

**Ask**: "Could we solve this problem by...?"

Generate 3-5 completely different solution approaches:
- If yes → Problem statement is appropriately broad
- If no → Too narrow or prescriptive

**Example**:
Problem: "Busy parents need quick, healthy meal solutions because they value family time over cooking time"

Possible solutions:
- ✅ Meal kit delivery service
- ✅ 15-minute recipe app
- ✅ Pre-made meal subscriptions
- ✅ AI meal planning assistant
- ✅ Community meal sharing platform

Multiple valid approaches = Good problem statement ✓

### Phase 5: Document and Share (5 minutes)

**Create problem statement document**:
```
PROBLEM STATEMENT

User Persona: [Name and brief description]

Core Problem:
[Final problem statement]

Evidence:
- User Quote 1: "..."
- User Quote 2: "..."
- Observed Behavior: ...
- Research Finding: ...

Impact:
- Affects: [X% of users / Y people]
- Frequency: [How often]
- Consequence: [What happens if unsolved]

Success Criteria:
- We'll know this is solved when...
- Measure: [How we'll measure success]
```

## Problem Statement Variations

### For Different User Segments

Create separate problem statements for:
- Novice vs. Expert users
- Different personas with distinct needs
- Varied contexts or use cases

**Example**:
- Novices: "New users need gentle guidance because they fear making mistakes"
- Experts: "Power users need efficiency shortcuts because repetitive clicks slow them down"

### For Different Journey Stages

Frame problems for specific stages:
- Awareness: Discovery and education
- Consideration: Evaluation and comparison
- Adoption: Onboarding and first use
- Retention: Ongoing value and engagement

### Problem vs. Opportunity Framing

**Problem framing**: Focus on pain
"Users struggle with X because Y"

**Opportunity framing**: Focus on aspiration
"Users want to achieve X but currently can't because Y"

Both are valid - choose based on context

## Common Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge: "Multiple problems competing"

**Solutions**:
- Create separate statements for each
- Prioritize using impact/feasibility matrix
- Start with one, iterate to others
- Consider creating problem statements for different phases

### Challenge: "Problem feels too specific/narrow"

**Solutions**:
- Zoom out one level (broader context)
- Ask "What's the larger need this serves?"
- Test with solution diversity (can you generate 5+ approaches?)
- Combine related narrow problems

### Challenge: "Stakeholders want business problem, not user problem"

**Solutions**:
- Show how user problem connects to business goal
- "When we solve [user problem], we'll achieve [business outcome]"
- Create separate framing for different audiences
- User problem drives design, business goal justifies investment

## Expected Outputs

1. **Final Problem Statement**: Clear, validated statement (1-3 sentences)
2. **Supporting Evidence**: Research quotes and data
3. **Problem Context**: Who's affected, frequency, impact
4. **Success Criteria**: How we'll know it's solved
5. **Problem Brief**: 1-page documentation

## Success Indicators

✅ **Clarity**: Anyone can understand the problem
✅ **Specificity**: Concrete user and context
✅ **Inspiration**: Team excited to solve it
✅ **Evidence**: Grounded in research
✅ **Openness**: Multiple solution paths possible
✅ **Impact**: Meaningful improvement if solved

## Examples by Domain

### SaaS Product
"Small business owners need simple financial tracking because accounting software is built for experts, resulting in missed deductions and tax stress"

### E-commerce
"Online shoppers need sizing confidence because product photos don't show fit, resulting in high return rates and purchase hesitation"

### Healthcare
"Elderly patients need medication adherence support because complex regimens are hard to remember, resulting in missed doses and health complications"

### Education
"Visual learners need multi-modal content because text-only materials don't match their learning style, resulting in lower comprehension and engagement"
