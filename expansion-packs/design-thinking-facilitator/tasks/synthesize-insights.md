# Task: Synthesize Insights

**Design Thinking Phase**: Define
**Duration**: 30-60 minutes
**Agent**: Problem Definer
**Difficulty**: Medium

## Purpose

Converge empathy research into core user needs and meaningful patterns that will inform problem statement creation.

## Prerequisites

- [ ] Empathy research completed
- [ ] Research synthesis done
- [ ] Empathy maps available
- [ ] Journey maps available
- [ ] Key insights identified
- [ ] Team assembled

## Step-by-Step Process

### Phase 1: Review Research Artifacts (10-15 minutes)

**Gather and display**:
- Empathy maps
- Journey maps
- Research synthesis report
- Key quotes
- Patterns identified

**Gallery walk**:
- Team silently reviews all materials
- Take notes on sticky notes
- Mark surprising insights

### Phase 2: Identify Core User Needs (15-20 minutes)

#### Transform Observations into Needs

**Observation → Need Framework**:

**Examples**:
- **Observation**: "Users email files to themselves"
  → **Need**: Simple, trusted file transfer across devices

- **Observation**: "Users skip onboarding tutorials"
  → **Need**: Immediate value without lengthy setup

- **Observation**: "Users ask colleagues for help constantly"
  → **Need**: Intuitive, self-explanatory interface

#### Need Statement Formula

```
[User] needs [verb: to/way to] [action/capability]
in order to [goal/outcome]
```

**Examples**:
- "Busy professionals need a way to share files instantly across devices in order to maintain productivity without interruption"
- "First-time users need to see immediate value in order to feel confident investing time to learn"
- "Non-technical users need intuitive guidance in order to complete tasks without external help"

#### Generate Need Statements

**Process**:
1. Review each major insight
2. Ask "What's the underlying need?"
3. Write need statement
4. Verify with evidence

**Output**: 10-15 core user needs

### Phase 3: Prioritize Needs (15-20 minutes)

#### Prioritization Criteria

**Impact**: How much does solving this improve UX?
- High: Transformative improvement
- Medium: Meaningful improvement
- Low: Nice to have

**Frequency**: How often do users encounter this?
- High: Every time / daily
- Medium: Weekly / regularly
- Low: Occasionally / rare

**Intensity**: How painful is this problem?
- High: Critical blocker, causes abandonment
- Medium: Significant frustration
- Low: Minor annoyance

**Alignment**: Does this fit business goals?
- High: Core to mission
- Medium: Important but not central
- Low: Tangential

#### Prioritization Methods

**Method 1: Dot Voting**
- Each person gets 5 votes
- Can stack votes on most important
- Top 3-5 needs emerge

**Method 2: Impact/Frequency Matrix**
```
             High Frequency
                  |
    High Impact   | CRITICAL
                  | (Focus here)
    ──────────────┼──────────────
    Low Impact    |
                  |
             Low Frequency
```

**Method 3: Forced Ranking**
- Stack rank all needs 1-15
- Top 5 advance to problem framing

### Phase 4: Cluster Related Needs (10-15 minutes)

**Group similar needs**:
- Which needs are related?
- What themes emerge?
- Can we combine any?

**Example Clusters**:
```
THEME: Speed & Efficiency
├─ Need for instant file access
├─ Need to skip lengthy setup
└─ Need for keyboard shortcuts

THEME: Trust & Confidence
├─ Need for data security
├─ Need for reliability
└─ Need for visible credibility
```

**Select representative needs**:
- Choose 1-2 needs per cluster
- Ensure coverage of all major themes
- Total: 3-5 priority needs

### Phase 5: Validate with Evidence (5-10 minutes)

For each priority need, verify:

**Evidence checklist**:
- [ ] Mentioned by 3+ users (pattern, not outlier)
- [ ] Supported by direct quotes
- [ ] Observed in behaviors (not just stated)
- [ ] Addresses root cause (not symptom)
- [ ] Actionable (we can design for it)

**Document evidence**:
```
NEED: Quick file sharing across devices

Evidence:
- 8/10 users mentioned cross-device workflow
- "I email files to myself 5 times a day" [P3]
- [OBS] All users working on 2+ devices
- Pain point: "Takes too long to sync" [P1, P5, P7]
- Journey map shows highest frustration at file transfer stage
```

## Expected Outputs

1. **Core Needs List**: 10-15 user needs identified
2. **Prioritized Needs**: Top 3-5 priority needs
3. **Need Clusters**: Thematic grouping
4. **Evidence Mapping**: Each need supported by research
5. **Synthesis Summary**: 1-page overview

## Common Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge: "Too many needs identified"

**Solutions**:
- Apply stricter prioritization criteria
- Combine related needs
- Focus on root needs vs. surface wants
- Start with top problem, iterate to others later

### Challenge: "Needs are too broad/vague"

**Solutions**:
- Add specificity: "for [specific user] when [specific context]"
- Break down into sub-needs
- Connect to specific user scenarios
- Make actionable and testable

### Challenge: "Team disagrees on priority"

**Solutions**:
- Return to research data (what did users emphasize most?)
- Vote on clear criteria (not personal preference)
- Use objective impact/frequency matrix
- Allow for multiple problem framings to explore

## Success Indicators

✅ **Research-grounded**: Needs based on actual user data
✅ **Specific**: Clear, focused needs (not vague)
✅ **Prioritized**: Top 3-5 identified
✅ **Evidence-backed**: Supporting data for each
✅ **Actionable**: Can be addressed in design
✅ **Team aligned**: Shared understanding of priorities

## Tips

**Do**:
- ✅ Focus on user needs, not business wants
- ✅ Look for root causes, not symptoms
- ✅ Prioritize ruthlessly
- ✅ Ground in evidence

**Don't**:
- ❌ Include solutions in need statements
- ❌ Use vague language ("better," "easier")
- ❌ List every possible need
- ❌ Assume without evidence
