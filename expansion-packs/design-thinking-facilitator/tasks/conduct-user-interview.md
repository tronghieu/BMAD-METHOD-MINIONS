# Task: Conduct User Interview

**Design Thinking Phase**: Empathize
**Duration**: 45-60 minutes per interview
**Agent**: Empathy Researcher
**Difficulty**: Medium

## Purpose

Conduct one-on-one interviews to uncover deep insights about user needs, motivations, and pain points through direct conversation and active listening.

## Prerequisites

- [ ] Interview guide prepared
- [ ] Participant recruited and confirmed
- [ ] Recording equipment tested
- [ ] Consent form ready
- [ ] Note-taking template prepared
- [ ] Research questions defined

## Interview Structure

### Opening (5 minutes)

**Build Rapport**:
- "Thank you for taking the time..."
- "Tell me a bit about yourself..."
- "There are no wrong answers"
- "We're learning from you"

**Set Expectations**:
- Explain purpose of interview
- Get recording permission
- Emphasize confidentiality
- Make them comfortable

### Core Interview (40-50 minutes)

#### Ask Open-Ended Questions

**Good Examples**:
- ✅ "Walk me through the last time you..."
- ✅ "What's frustrating about..."
- ✅ "How do you currently..."
- ✅ "Tell me more about that experience..."

**Avoid**:
- ❌ "Do you like...?" (Yes/no question)
- ❌ "Wouldn't it be better if..." (Leading)
- ❌ Multiple questions at once
- ❌ Questions with implied solutions

#### The "Five Whys" Technique

Drill down to root causes:
```
User: "I don't use feature X"
You: "Why not?"
User: "It's complicated"
You: "What makes it complicated?"
User: "Too many steps"
You: "Why are those steps problematic?"
User: "I forget halfway through"
You: "Why is that?"
User: "No clear progress indicator"
→ ROOT CAUSE DISCOVERED
```

#### Listen For

- **Workarounds**: "I use a spreadsheet instead..."
- **Emotional language**: "I hate when..." "I love..."
- **Stories**: Concrete examples reveal truth
- **Contradictions**: What they say vs. do
- **Hesitations**: Pauses indicate complexity

#### Probing Techniques

- **Silent pauses**: Count to 5 before next question
- **"Tell me more..."**: Gets depth on any answer
- **"Show me"**: Ask for demonstration
- **"Can you give an example?"**: Make it concrete
- **"How did that make you feel?"**: Uncover emotions

### Closing (5 minutes)

- "Is there anything else you'd like to share?"
- "What haven't I asked about that I should have?"
- Thank them for their time
- Explain next steps
- Provide compensation

## Note-Taking Best Practices

### During Interview

Capture:
- **Verbatim quotes** (use quotation marks)
- **Observations** [OBS]
- **Emotions** [EMO]
- **Body language** notes
- **Timestamp** key moments

**Template**:
```
Participant: P7 (Sarah, age 34, frequent user)
Date: [date]
Duration: 52 min

[00:05] "I try to use it every day but usually give up"
[00:12] [OBS] Showed frustration when describing login
[00:18] [EMO] Lit up when talking about feature X
[00:23] "My workaround is to just email it to myself"

Key insights:
- Authentication is major friction point
- Feature X is high value
- Email remains default tool
```

### Post-Interview (Within 1 hour)

- Review notes, fill gaps
- Highlight surprising insights
- Note quotes to use later
- Rate session quality (1-5)
- Schedule follow-ups if needed

## Common Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge: "Participant gives surface-level answers"

**Solutions**:
- Ask for specific stories: "Tell me about the last time..."
- Use "5 Whys" to drill down
- Request demonstrations: "Show me how you..."
- Build more rapport before diving deep

### Challenge: "Participant wants to design solutions"

**Solutions**:
- Redirect: "That's interesting - what problem does that solve?"
- Focus on current: "How do you handle this today?"
- Acknowledge then pivot: "Good idea - but first, tell me why that matters?"

### Challenge: "Running out of questions"

**Solutions**:
- Ask about specific instances
- Explore context: "What else is happening when...?"
- Ask about alternatives: "What have you tried?"
- Probe emotions: "How does that make you feel?"

## Expected Outputs

1. **Interview Recording**: Audio/video file
2. **Interview Notes**: Detailed observations and quotes
3. **Key Insights**: 3-5 main takeaways
4. **Follow-up Questions**: Items for additional research

## Success Indicators

✅ **Rich quotes**: Participant shared specific stories
✅ **Emotional depth**: Uncovered feelings and motivations
✅ **Concrete examples**: Specific instances, not generalities
✅ **Surprising insights**: Learned something unexpected
✅ **Good rapport**: Participant was comfortable and open
