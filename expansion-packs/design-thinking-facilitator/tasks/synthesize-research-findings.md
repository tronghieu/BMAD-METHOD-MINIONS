# Task: Synthesize Research Findings

**Design Thinking Phase**: Empathize → Define (Bridge)
**Duration**: 4-8 hours
**Agent**: Empathy Researcher
**Difficulty**: Medium-High

## Purpose

Transform raw research data into actionable insights, patterns, and themes that will inform problem definition and solution ideation.

## Prerequisites

- [ ] All research sessions completed
- [ ] Interview notes and recordings available
- [ ] Observation data collected
- [ ] Empathy maps created (optional but helpful)
- [ ] Journey maps created (optional but helpful)
- [ ] Team available for synthesis session
- [ ] Large workspace or digital board ready

## Step-by-Step Process

### Phase 1: Organize Raw Data (30-60 minutes)

#### Create Research Repository

**File Structure**:
```
/research-synthesis
  /raw-data
    /interviews
      - participant-01-transcript.md
      - participant-02-transcript.md
    /observations
      - session-01-notes.md
      - session-02-notes.md
    /photos
    /recordings
  /synthesis
    - affinity-map.md
    - key-insights.md
    - themes.md
    - quotes.md
```

#### Prepare Data for Analysis

1. **Transcribe recordings** (if not already done)
2. **Clean up notes** (fill gaps, clarify)
3. **Extract quotes** (verbatim user statements)
4. **Gather artifacts** (photos, screenshots, sketches)
5. **Tag data** by participant, theme, or topic

### Phase 2: Immersion (30-60 minutes)

**Review All Research Materials**:
- Read through all transcripts
- Review all notes
- Watch key video segments
- Look at photos/artifacts

**Stay Open**:
- Don't jump to conclusions
- Notice patterns without forcing them
- Stay curious
- Question assumptions

**Initial Observations**:
- What surprises you?
- What's recurring?
- What contradicts expectations?
- What's missing?

### Phase 3: Affinity Mapping (2-3 hours)

#### Extract Atomic Insights

**Create Insight Cards**:
- One observation/quote per card (sticky note)
- Keep them atomic (single idea)
- Use participant's words when possible
- Include context

**Example Cards**:
```
"I email files to myself because
I don't trust cloud storage"
[P3, busy professional]

[OBS] User clicked back button
5 times looking for home
[Session 2, observation]

"Setup took 20 minutes,
I almost gave up"
[P7, first-time user]
```

#### Cluster Similar Insights

**Process** (Silent, then Collaborative):

1. **Individual clustering** (15 min)
   - Each person reviews all cards
   - Start grouping similar items
   - Don't discuss yet

2. **Group discussion** (30 min)
   - Share clustering rationale
   - Merge similar groups
   - Debate placements
   - Allow movement

3. **Name clusters** (15 min)
   - What theme connects these?
   - Label each cluster
   - Define boundaries

**Typical Cluster Types**:
- Pain points & frustrations
- Workarounds & coping strategies
- Goals & motivations
- Context & environment
- Current tools & solutions
- Emotional responses
- Behaviors & habits
- Unmet needs

#### Organize into Hierarchy

```
THEME: Trust & Security Concerns
├─ Sub-theme: Data Privacy Fears
│  ├─ "Don't know where data is stored"
│  ├─ "Worried about breaches"
│  └─ "No control over access"
├─ Sub-theme: Reliability Doubts
│  ├─ "What if it goes down?"
│  ├─ "Can't access offline"
│  └─ "Lost data once before"
└─ Sub-theme: Credibility Questions
   ├─ "Never heard of this company"
   ├─ "No social proof"
   └─ "Looks unprofessional"
```

### Phase 4: Identify Patterns (1-2 hours)

#### Pattern Recognition

**Look For**:

**Frequency Patterns**:
- How many users mentioned this? (3+ = pattern)
- How often does this occur?

**Intensity Patterns**:
- Strong emotional reactions
- Extreme language
- Repeated emphasis

**Contradiction Patterns**:
- Says one thing, does another
- Conflicts between users
- Internal inconsistencies

**Causation Patterns**:
- "X causes Y"
- Root causes vs. symptoms
- Chain reactions

**Temporal Patterns**:
- "Always happens at the start"
- "Gets worse over time"
- Seasonal or contextual

#### Validate Patterns

**Ask**:
- Is this supported by evidence? (not assumption)
- How many users experienced this?
- Is this a pattern or outlier?
- What's the root cause?
- Does this matter for our goals?

### Phase 5: Generate Insights (1-2 hours)

#### Transform Observations into Insights

**Framework**:
```
OBSERVATION → INSIGHT

Observation: "8 of 10 users email files to themselves"
         ↓
     WHY?
         ↓
Insight: "Users don't trust cloud storage or find it
too complex; email is their universal, reliable tool"
```

**Insight Quality Criteria**:
- ✅ Reveals underlying need (not surface problem)
- ✅ Suggests opportunity space
- ✅ Based on patterns (3+ users)
- ✅ Surprising or counter-intuitive
- ✅ Actionable for design
- ✅ Specific and concrete

**Insight Statement Templates**:

**Template 1**:
"[User segment] needs [need] because [underlying reason]"

**Template 2**:
"When [context], users [behavior] in order to [goal/need]"

**Template 3**:
"Users believe [belief], which leads them to [behavior], resulting in [outcome]"

#### Examples of Strong Insights

✅ **Good Insights**:
- "Busy professionals use workarounds (email, spreadsheets) not because they prefer them, but because learning new tools feels riskier than sticking with the familiar"
- "Users don't skip onboarding because they're impatient, but because they need immediate value to justify time investment"
- "Trust isn't built through security features alone, but through visible social proof and professional credibility signals"

❌ **Weak Insights** (too surface-level):
- "Users want faster performance" (obvious)
- "People prefer simple interfaces" (generic)
- "Some users had problems" (vague)

### Phase 6: Prioritize Insights (30-60 minutes)

#### Prioritization Criteria

**Impact**: How much does this affect user experience?
**Frequency**: How many users does this affect?
**Intensity**: How painful/important is this?
**Actionability**: Can we address this?
**Alignment**: Does this fit our goals?

#### Prioritization Methods

**Dot Voting**:
- Each person gets 5 votes
- Can stack on favorites
- Top 10 insights emerge

**Impact/Frequency Matrix**:
```
        High Frequency
             |
High Impact  |  CRITICAL
             |  Focus here
─────────────┼─────────────
Low Impact   |
             |
        Low Frequency
```

**Forced Ranking**:
- Stack rank all insights
- Force trade-offs
- Top 5-10 move forward

### Phase 7: Create Synthesis Deliverables (1-2 hours)

#### Research Synthesis Report

**Structure**:

1. **Executive Summary** (1 page)
   - Research objectives
   - Methods used
   - Participant overview
   - Top 5 insights
   - Recommended focus areas

2. **Key Insights** (3-5 pages)
   - Each insight with:

## Common Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge: "Overwhelmed by amount of data"

**Solutions**:
- Start with high-level themes, then details
- Focus on patterns first (3+ mentions)
- Do synthesis in stages (not all at once)
- Involve team (distribute cognitive load)

### Challenge: "Everything seems important"

**Solutions**:
- Apply forced prioritization
- Link to project goals
- Focus on impact and frequency
- Parking lot for "nice to know"

### Challenge: "Conflicting findings"

**Solutions**:
- Look for user segments
- Check for context differences
- Both could be true for different users
- Design for primary, accommodate secondary

### Challenge: "Team disagrees on interpretation"

**Solutions**:
- Return to source data
- Validate with more research if critical
- Document disagreement and hypotheses
- Test assumptions in prototype
