# Task: Evaluate and Prioritize Ideas

**Design Thinking Phase**: Ideate (Convergent)
**Duration**: 30-45 minutes
**Agent**: Ideation Coach
**Difficulty**: Medium

## Purpose

Select the most promising ideas for prototyping through systematic evaluation and prioritization, narrowing from many ideas to 3-5 top concepts.

## Prerequisites

- [ ] Ideas clustered and themed
- [ ] Team assembled with decision-makers
- [ ] Evaluation criteria defined
- [ ] Voting materials ready (dots, markers)
- [ ] Time allocated for discussion

## Convergent Thinking Mindset

**Shift from divergent to convergent**:
- ✅ Now we CAN evaluate and critique
- ✅ Apply judgment and feasibility lens
- ✅ Make trade-offs and hard choices
- ✅ Focus on most promising paths

**But maintain**:
- Don't dismiss wild ideas too quickly
- Look for potential, not just polish
- Consider multiple criteria, not just one

## Step-by-Step Process

### Phase 1: Initial Filtering (5-10 minutes)

#### Quick Elimination

**Remove**:
- Exact duplicates (keep better-articulated version)
- Truly out-of-scope (violate hard constraints)
- Non-starters (proven impossible)

**Keep everything else** - including:
- Wild ideas (may inspire realistic ones)
- Similar ideas (subtle differences matter)
- Unclear ideas (clarify before removing)

### Phase 2: Select Evaluation Method (5 minutes)

Choose based on:
- Time available
- Team size
- Decision complexity
- Stakeholder needs

#### Method 1: Dot Voting (Fastest - 10 min)

**Process**:
1. Each person gets 3-5 votes
2. Can stack votes on favorites
3. Can vote on own ideas
4. Mark with dots/stickers
5. Top 5-10 move forward

**Pros**: Fast, democratic, visual
**Cons**: Can be popularity contest

#### Method 2: Impact/Effort Matrix (Medium - 20 min)

**Setup**:
```
      High Impact
           |
    Quick Wins | Major Projects
           |
───────────┼────────────
    Fill-ins | Time Sinks
           |
      Low Impact
       Low Effort → High Effort
```

**Process**:
1. Draw 2x2 grid
2. Place ideas on matrix
3. Discuss placements
4. Focus on Quick Wins first
5. Consider Major Projects for long-term

**Pros**: Considers multiple factors
**Cons**: Takes more time

#### Method 3: NUF Test (Thorough - 30 min)

Rate each idea 1-5 on:
- **N**ew: How novel/innovative?
- **U**seful: How valuable to users?
- **F**easible: How realistic to build?

**Scoring**:
- Multiply: N × U × F = Total score
- Or add: N + U + F = Total score
- Top scores advance

**Pros**: Comprehensive, balanced
**Cons**: Time-consuming for many ideas

#### Method 4: Criteria Matrix (Most Thorough - 45 min)

| Idea | Impact | Feasibility | Speed | Cost | Alignment | Total |
|------|--------|-------------|-------|------|-----------|-------|
| A    | 4      | 3           | 5     | 4    | 5         | 21    |
| B    | 5      | 2           | 3     | 2    | 4         | 16    |

**Custom criteria based on context**

**Pros**: Tailored, objective
**Cons**: Requires pre-defined criteria

### Phase 3: Conduct Evaluation (15-25 minutes)

#### Execute Chosen Method

**For Dot Voting**:
1. Brief review of all ideas (read aloud)
2. Silent voting (2 minutes)
3. Count votes
4. Discuss top vote-getters
5. Any surprises?

**For Impact/Effort Matrix**:
1. Place obvious ones first (very high/low)
2. Debate middle ones
3. Cluster by quadrant
4. Focus discussion on top-right (high impact)

**For Scoring Methods** (NUF, Matrix):
1. Score individually first
2. Average scores
3. Discuss high/low outliers
4. Adjust if needed
5. Rank by total score

### Phase 4: Discussion and Selection (10-15 minutes)

#### Review Top Candidates

**For top 10-15 ideas, discuss**:

**Strengths**:
- What's exciting about this?
- What user need does it address?
- What makes it different?

**Concerns**:
- What are the risks?
- What's unknown?
- What could go wrong?

**Feasibility**:
- Can we prototype this?
- What resources needed?
- How long to test?

#### Select Final Concepts

**Choose 3-5 ideas** considering:

**Diversity**:
- Different approaches (not 3 similar ideas)
- Mix of quick wins and big bets
- Coverage of different user needs

**Portfolio Approach**:
- 1-2 "Safe bets" (likely to succeed)
- 1-2 "Promising innovations" (higher potential, higher risk)
- 1 "Wild card" (unconventional, could surprise)

**Testability**:
- Can we prototype this?
- Can we get user feedback?
- Will we learn something valuable?

#### Document Selection Rationale

**For each selected idea**:
```
IDEA: [Name/Description]
Selected because:
- [Reason 1: User impact]
- [Reason 2: Feasibility]
- [Reason 3: Strategic fit]

Next steps:
- [What to prototype]
- [What to test]
- [Who builds it]
```

## Common Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge: "Too many good ideas, can't choose"

**Solutions**:
- Stack rank top 10, force cuts
- "Which could we prototype fastest?"
- "Which would users value most?"
- Multi-stage voting: narrow 20→10→5→3
- Test multiple if resources allow

### Challenge: "Selected ideas are too similar"

**Solutions**:
- Force variety: "One safe, one bold, one unexpected"
- "Pick from different clusters"
- "What's the opposite approach?"
- Ensure breadth before depth

### Challenge: "Team split on favorites"

**Solutions**:
- Use objective scoring
- Prototype both, let users decide
- Look for compromise/hybrid
- Decision-maker breaks tie
- Test assumptions that drive disagreement

### Challenge: "Wild ideas dismissed too quickly"

**Solutions**:
- Reserve one slot for "wild card"
- Ask "What would make this feasible?"
- "What's the kernel of insight here?"
- Consider scaled-down version

## Success Indicators

✅ **Focused**: Narrowed from many to 3-5 concepts
✅ **Diverse**: Different approaches represented
✅ **Justified**: Clear rationale for each selection
✅ **Testable**: Can be prototyped and validated
✅ **Team alignment**: Consensus on top picks

## Tips

**Do**:
- ✅ Use multiple criteria (not just one)
- ✅ Allow discussion and debate
- ✅ Document decisions (rationale matters)
- ✅ Mix safe and risky ideas
- ✅ Keep user needs central

**Don't**:
- ❌ Rush the decision
- ❌ Pick all similar ideas
- ❌ Let loudest voice win
- ❌ Ignore feasibility entirely
- ❌ Choose based on personal preference alone

## Next Phase
