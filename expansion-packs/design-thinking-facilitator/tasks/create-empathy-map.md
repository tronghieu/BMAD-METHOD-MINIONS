# Task: Create Empathy Map

**Design Thinking Phase**: Empathize
**Duration**: 30-60 minutes
**Agent**: Empathy Researcher

## Purpose

Synthesize user research into a visual framework that captures what users say, think, do, and feel, building shared team understanding and empathy.

## Prerequisites

- [ ] User research completed (interviews, observations)
- [ ] Research notes organized
- [ ] Team assembled (3-8 people ideal)
- [ ] Large workspace (wall or digital board)
- [ ] Sticky notes and markers ready

## Empathy Map Structure

## Step-by-Step Process

### Phase 1: Preparation (5 minutes)

1. **Set up the canvas**
   - Draw quadrants on wall or digital board
   - Label: Says, Thinks, Does, Feels
   - Add Pains (bottom) and Gains (top)

2. **Gather research materials**
   - Interview transcripts
   - Observation notes
   - Photos/videos
   - Survey data

3. **Brief the team**
   - Explain purpose
   - Review quadrant meanings
   - Set ground rules (one idea per note)

### Phase 2: Individual Review (10-15 minutes)

**Silent Work**:
- Each person reviews research materials
- Write observations on sticky notes
- One insight per note
- Use different colors for different users (if multiple)

**What to Capture**:
- Direct quotes → SAYS
- Inferred thoughts → THINKS
- Observed actions → DOES
- Emotional states → FEELS

### Phase 3: Collaborative Mapping (25-35 minutes)

#### Says Quadrant (5-7 minutes)

**Capture**:
- Direct user quotes
- Actual statements from interviews
- What they explicitly verbalized

**Examples**:
- "I don't have time to learn new tools"
- "It needs to just work"
- "I wish it was simpler"
- "This is confusing"

#### Thinks Quadrant (5-7 minutes)

**Capture**:
- Thoughts not spoken aloud
- Beliefs and assumptions
- Internal motivations
- Concerns and worries

**Examples**:
- Worried about making mistakes
- Desires simplicity
- Values efficiency
- Skeptical of new solutions
- Fears looking incompetent

#### Does Quadrant (5-7 minutes)

**Capture**:
- Observable behaviors
- Actions taken
- Current workflows
- Workarounds created

**Examples**:
- Uses Excel for everything
- Emails files to self
- Skips certain features
- Asks colleagues for help
- Googles solutions

#### Feels Quadrant (5-7 minutes)

**Capture**:
- Emotional states
- Feelings during experience
- Attitude changes
- Emotional highs/lows

**Examples**:
- Frustrated during setup
- Anxious about errors
- Delighted by quick wins
- Overwhelmed by complexity
- Confident when succeeding

#### Pains Section (5 minutes)

**Identify**:
- Frustrations
- Obstacles
- Fears
- Challenges
- Barriers

**Examples**:
- Takes too long
- Too complex
- Unreliable
- Expensive
- Requires expertise

#### Gains Section (5 minutes)

**Identify**:
- Goals
- Aspirations
- Success criteria
- Desired outcomes
- Measures of success

**Examples**:
- Save time
- Reduce errors
- Feel confident
- Impress stakeholders
- Simplify workflow

### Phase 4: Synthesis (5-10 minutes)

**Look for patterns**:
- What's consistent across quadrants?
- Any contradictions (says vs. does)?
- Strongest emotions?
- Biggest pain points?
- Most important gains?

**Generate insights**:
Transform observations into insight statements:
- "[User] needs [need] because [insight from map]"

**Example**:
"Busy professionals need quick file sharing because they work across devices and lack time for complex tools (from: SAYS 'no time to learn', DOES 'emails to self', FEELS 'frustrated', PAIN 'too complex')"

## Empathy Map Variations

### Extended Empathy Map

Add additional sections:
- **HEARS**: What they hear from others, media, influencers
- **SEES**: What they observe in their environment

### Journey-Based Empathy Map

Create separate maps for different journey stages:
- During awareness phase
- During consideration
- During use
- When problem occurs

### Comparative Empathy Map

Create maps for different personas:
- Novice vs. Expert user
- Mobile vs. Desktop user
- Different role types

## Expected Outputs

1. **Completed Empathy Map**: Visual synthesis of user research
2. **Key Insights**: 5-10 main patterns identified
3. **Pain Points**: Prioritized list of frustrations
4. **Opportunities**: Areas where we can help users
5. **Photos**: Documentation of completed map

## Quality Checklist

- [ ] All four quadrants populated
- [ ] Based on real research evidence (not assumptions)
- [ ] Includes specific quotes and examples
- [ ] Pains and gains clearly identified
- [ ] Team participated and aligned
- [ ] Patterns and contradictions noted
- [ ] Photos/documentation captured

## Common Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge: "Confusing Says vs. Thinks"

**Solution**:
- SAYS = Exact quotes from interviews
- THINKS = Inferences from behavior/context
- If unsure, mark as assumption to validate

### Challenge: "Too much data to fit"

**Solution**:
- Focus on patterns (3+ users)
- Cluster similar items
- Create separate maps for different personas
- Prioritize most impactful insights

### Challenge: "Team disagrees on placement"

**Solution**:
- Discuss and decide together
- Note disagreements for validation
- Allow duplicates if truly fits multiple quadrants
- Return to source data for evidence

## Success Indicators

✅ **Evidence-based**: Grounded in actual research
✅ **Comprehensive**: All quadrants filled meaningfully
✅ **Specific**: Concrete examples, not vague generalities
✅ **Insightful**: Reveals non-obvious patterns
✅ **Team alignment**: Shared understanding achieved
✅ **Actionable**: Points to clear opportunity areas

## Tips for Virtual/Remote Sessions

- Use digital whiteboard (Miro, Mural, FigJam)
- Pre-populate with research quotes
- Use color coding for different users
- Breakout rooms for small group work
- Use voting/reactions for prioritization
- Screen share final synthesis
