# Task: Build Rapid Prototype

**Design Thinking Phase**: Prototype
**Duration**: 1 hour - 3 days (depends on fidelity)
**Agent**: Prototype Builder
**Difficulty**: Medium

## Purpose

Create a tangible representation of selected concepts to test assumptions and gather user feedback. Prototypes should be built quickly and cheaply to enable rapid learning and iteration.

## Prerequisites

- [ ] **Top concepts selected** from ideation (3-5 ideas)
- [ ] **Testing objectives defined** (what do we need to learn?)
- [ ] **Fidelity level chosen** (paper, digital, functional)
- [ ] **Materials/tools ready** (supplies or software)
- [ ] **Testing plan** (who will test, when, how)
- [ ] **Team availability** (builders, testers)

## Key Principle: Build to Think & Learn

**Purpose of prototypes**:
- ✅ Test assumptions quickly
- ✅ Get user feedback early
- ✅ Compare multiple solutions
- ✅ Communicate ideas to team
- ❌ Build perfect product
- ❌ Impress stakeholders
- ❌ Spend weeks polishing

**Mantra**: "Prototype like it's your last dollar and final hour"

## Fidelity Selection Guide

### Low-Fidelity (1-4 hours)

**When to use**:
- Early exploration
- Testing core concepts
- Multiple ideas to compare
- Limited budget

**Methods**:
- **Paper Sketches**: Hand-drawn screens/flows
- **Storyboards**: Comic-strip of user journey
- **Physical Mockups**: Cardboard, clay, LEGOs
- **Wizard of Oz**: Human simulates system

**Tools**: Paper, markers, scissors, tape

### Medium-Fidelity (4 hours - 2 days)

**When to use**:
- Refining interactions
- Testing workflows
- Getting detailed feedback
- Stakeholder buy-in

**Methods**:
- **Clickable Wireframes**: Interactive mockups
- **Digital Prototypes**: Figma, Sketch, Adobe XD
- **Video Prototypes**: Demo video showing concept
- **3D Printed Models**: Physical prototypes

**Tools**: Figma, InVision, PowerPoint, 3D printer

### High-Fidelity (2-5 days)

**When to use**:
- Final validation
- Technical feasibility testing
- Investor/executive demos
- Handoff to development

**Methods**:
- **Coded Prototypes**: HTML/CSS/JS frontends
- **No-Code Apps**: Bubble, Webflow, Adalo
- **Service Prototypes**: Role-play full experience
- **Working Models**: Functional but limited

**Tools**: Code editors, no-code platforms, actual materials

## Step-by-Step Process

### Phase 1: Planning (15-30 minutes)

#### 1.1 Define What to Test

For each concept, identify:
- **Core assumption**: What must be true for this to work?
- **Riskiest aspect**: What are we most uncertain about?
- **Key interactions**: Critical user flows to show
- **Success criteria**: What feedback indicates success?

#### 1.2 Choose Fidelity

Use checklist:
- How much time do we have? (Less time = lower fidelity)
- How uncertain are we? (More uncertain = lower fidelity)
- Testing what aspect? (Concept = low, interaction = medium, technical = high)
- How many concepts? (Multiple = low fidelity for each)

**Output**: Fidelity decision for each prototype

#### 1.3 Assign Build Team

- Who builds what?
- What's the deadline?
- What tools will be used?
- When will we review progress?

### Phase 2: Building (varies by fidelity)

#### Paper Prototype Process (1-4 hours)

**Materials**: Paper, markers, scissors, sticky notes

**Steps**:
1. **Sketch key screens** (one per paper)
   - Keep it rough - stick figures fine
   - Focus on layout and content, not design
   - Label interactive elements

2. **Create interaction elements**
   - Buttons, menus, pop-ups on separate papers
   - Can swap in/out during testing

3. **Map user flow**
   - Arrange screens in sequence
   - Note transitions and interactions

4. **Test internally**
   - Walk through with team
   - Identify missing screens
   - Practice explaining interactions

**Example**: Mobile app prototype
- Home screen (paper 1)
- Menu overlay (sticky note)
- Detail screen (paper 2)
- Confirmation dialog (small paper)
- Success state (paper 3)

#### Digital Prototype Process (4-24 hours)

**Tools**: Figma, Adobe XD, Sketch, InVision

**Steps**:
1. **Create screens** (2-4 hours)
   - Use UI kits for speed
   - Focus on key flows, not every edge case
   - Placeholder content is fine

2. **Add interactions** (1-2 hours)
   - Link screens with hotspots
   - Simple transitions (fade, slide)
   - Basic states (hover, click)

3. **Build 2-3 critical flows** (1-2 hours)
   - Happy path (everything works)
   - One error case
   - Exit/back flow

4. **Test on device** (30 minutes)
   - View on actual phone/tablet
   - Check readability, tap targets
   - Fix major issues only

**Speed tips**:
- Reuse components (buttons, headers)
- Copy screens and modify vs creating new
- Use symbols/components for consistency
- Don't design every state - describe them

#### Service Prototype Process (2-8 hours)

**For service/experience design**:

1. **Script the experience** (1-2 hours)
   - Customer journey steps
   - Touchpoints and interactions
   - Employee roles and actions
   - Physical artifacts needed

2. **Create props** (1-3 hours)
   - Printed materials (menus, forms, cards)
   - Environmental elements (signage)
   - Digital mockups (app screens, emails)

3. **Rehearse** (1-2 hours)
   - Walk through service sequence
   - Practice role-play
   - Time the experience
   - Refine awkward moments

4. **Set the stage** (1 hour)
   - Arrange physical space
   - Prepare all materials
   - Brief team members on roles

### Phase 3: Test Readiness (15-30 minutes)

#### Pre-Test Checklist

- [ ] Prototype covers key user flows
- [ ] All necessary screens/states created
- [ ] Interactions work (or can be simulated)
- [ ] Team knows how to "operate" prototype
- [ ] Testing scenarios written
- [ ] Questions to ask users prepared
- [ ] Recording setup ready

#### Internal Walkthrough

Before user testing:
1. Role-play user scenarios
2. Identify confusing elements
3. Fix show-stopper issues
4. Practice facilitation
5. Time the test run

**Rule**: If team member can't figure it out, users won't either

## Expected Outputs

1. **Working Prototype**: Tangible artifact users can interact with
2. **User Scenarios**: 2-3 tasks for users to attempt
3. **Testing Protocol**: Questions and observation guide
4. **Documentation**: Photos/screenshots of prototype
5. **Assumptions List**: What this prototype tests

## Common Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge: "Perfectionism - want to polish it"

**Solutions**:
- Time-box ruthlessly (set 4-hour deadline)
- Embrace ugliness (messy = fast learning)
- Remember: This will be thrown away
- "Good enough to test" is the goal

### Challenge: "Too many screens to build"

**Solutions**:
- Build only critical path
- Use placeholders for secondary features
- Describe instead of building ("After clicking, you'd see...")
- Prioritize riskiest assumptions

### Challenge: "Technical limitations with tools"

**Solutions**:
- Drop fidelity level
- Fake it (manually advance slides)
- Use simpler tool
- Wizard of Oz technique (human operates behind scenes)

### Challenge: "Multiple concepts to prototype"

**Solutions**:
- Start with paper for all
- Build digital only for top performer
- Test concepts in sequence, refine winner
- Parallel teams building simultaneously

## Prototyping Best Practices

**Do**:
- ✅ Start low-fidelity, increase only if needed
- ✅ Focus on testable assumptions
- ✅ Build just enough to learn
- ✅ Iterate quickly based on feedback
- ✅ Make it look unfinished (invites feedback)

**Don't**:
- ❌ Spend more than 20% of time on visuals
- ❌ Build features not being tested
- ❌ Get attached - be ready to throw away
- ❌ Explain during test - let it speak for itself
- ❌ Wait for perfection to test

## Success Indicators

✅ **Testable**: Users can interact meaningfully
✅ **Fast**: Built in time budget
✅ **Focused**: Tests specific assumptions
✅ **Disposable**: Team ready to change/discard
✅ **Communicative**: Concept is clear to users
