# Severity & Priority Rubric (with SLA)

Severity (Impact):
- S0 Critical: Production down, data loss, security breach → Immediate
- S1 High: Major functionality broken; widespread impact → 1–2 days
- S2 Medium: Important but with workaround; limited impact → 3–7 days
- S3 Low: Minor issue, cosmetic, docs → Next iteration

Priority (Urgency):
- P0: Must address now (often S0/S1 in production)
- P1: Address in current/next sprint
- P2: Plan in backlog
- P3: Nice to have

SLA (guideline, adjust per org):
- P0: Start within 2h; resolve within 24h
- P1: Start within 24h; resolve within 3 days
- P2: Schedule within 2 weeks
- P3: Schedule when feasible
