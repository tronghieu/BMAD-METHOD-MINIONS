# Reproduction Guide

Goals
- Reproduce reliably
- Minimize steps/scope
- Capture environment and evidence

Tips
- Prefer deterministic paths; avoid flaky inputs
- Reduce to smallest dataset/state that reproduces
- Toggle logging levels to capture useful traces
- Record OS/Device/AppVersion/Build/Locale
- Save assets under `docs/bugs/assets/<id>/`

Evidence Examples
- Screenshots (with timestamps)
- Console logs / server logs
- Network traces (HAR)
- Crash dumps / stack traces
- Minimal repro code snippet or script
